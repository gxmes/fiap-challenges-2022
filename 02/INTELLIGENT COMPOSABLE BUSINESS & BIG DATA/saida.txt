By	1

Chapter	1
1	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
truth	1
universally	1
acknowledged,	1
that	1
a	1
single	1
man	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
fortune,	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
wife.	1
However	1
little	1
known	1
the	1
feelings	1
or	1
views	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
be	1
on	1
his	1
first	1
entering	1
a	1
neighbourhood,	1
this	1
truth	1
is	1
so	1
well	1
fixed	1
in	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
surrounding	1
families,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
considered	1
the	1
rightful	1
property	1
of	1
some	1
one	1
or	1
other	1
of	1
their	1
daughters.	1
"My	1
dear	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,"	1
said	1
his	1
lady	1
to	1
him	1
one	1
day,	1
"have	1
you	1
heard	1
that	1
Netherfield	1
Park	1
is	1
let	1
at	1
last?"	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not.	1
"But	1
it	1
is,"	1
returned	1
she;	1
"for	1
Mrs.	1
Long	1
has	1
just	1
been	1
here,	1
and	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
all	1
about	1
it."	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
made	1
no	1
answer.	1
"Do	1
you	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
who	1
has	1
taken	1
it?"	1
cried	1
his	1
wife	1
impatiently.	1
"_You_	1
want	1
to	1
tell	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
hearing	1
it."	1
This	1
was	1
invitation	1
enough.	1
"Why,	1
my	1
dear,	1
you	1
must	1
know,	1
Mrs.	1
Long	1
says	1
that	1
Netherfield	1
is	1
taken	1
by	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
large	1
fortune	1
from	1
the	1
north	1
of	1
England;	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
on	1
Monday	1
in	1
a	1
chaise	1
and	1
four	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
place,	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
delighted	1
with	1
it,	1
that	1
he	1
agreed	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Morris	1
immediately;	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
possession	1
before	1
Michaelmas,	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
by	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
next	1
week."	1
"What	1
is	1
his	1
name?"	1
"Bingley."	1
"Is	1
he	1
married	1
or	1
single?"	1
"Oh!	1
Single,	1
my	1
dear,	1
to	1
be	1
sure!	1
A	1
single	1
man	1
of	1
large	1
fortune;	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
thousand	1
a	1
year.	1
What	1
a	1
fine	1
thing	1
for	1
our	1
girls!"	1
"How	1
so?	1
How	1
can	1
it	1
affect	1
them?"	1
"My	1
dear	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,"	1
replied	1
his	1
wife,	1
"how	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
tiresome!	1
You	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
marrying	1
one	1
of	1
them."	1
"Is	1
that	1
his	1
design	1
in	1
settling	1
here?"	1
"Design!	1
Nonsense,	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
talk	1
so!	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
likely	1
that	1
he	1
_may_	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
therefore	1
you	1
must	1
visit	1
him	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
comes."	1
"I	1
see	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
that.	1
You	1
and	1
the	1
girls	1
may	1
go,	1
or	1
you	1
may	1
send	1
them	1
by	1
themselves,	1
which	1
perhaps	1
will	1
be	1
still	1
better,	1
for	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
as	1
handsome	1
as	1
any	1
of	1
them,	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
may	1
like	1
you	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
party."	1
"My	1
dear,	1
you	1
flatter	1
me.	1
I	1
certainly	1
_have_	1
had	1
my	1
share	1
of	1
beauty,	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
anything	1
extraordinary	1
now.	1
When	1
a	1
woman	1
has	1
five	1
grown-up	1
daughters,	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
over	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
beauty."	1
"In	1
such	1
cases,	1
a	1
woman	1
has	1
not	1
often	1
much	1
beauty	1
to	1
think	1
of."	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear,	1
you	1
must	1
indeed	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
into	1
the	1
neighbourhood."	1
"It	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
engage	1
for,	1
I	1
assure	1
you."	1
"But	1
consider	1
your	1
daughters.	1
Only	1
think	1
what	1
an	1
establishment	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
Sir	1
William	1
and	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
are	1
determined	1
to	1
go,	1
merely	1
on	1
that	1
account,	1
for	1
in	1
general,	1
you	1
know,	1
they	1
visit	1
no	1
newcomers.	1
Indeed	1
you	1
must	1
go,	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
impossible	1
for	1
_us_	1
to	1
visit	1
him	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not."	1
"You	1
are	1
over-scrupulous,	1
surely.	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
by	1
you	1
to	1
assure	1
him	1
of	1
my	1
hearty	1
consent	1
to	1
his	1
marrying	1
whichever	1
he	1
chooses	1
of	1
the	1
girls;	1
though	1
I	1
must	1
throw	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
word	1
for	1
my	1
little	1
Lizzy."	1
"I	1
desire	1
you	1
will	1
do	1
no	1
such	1
thing.	1
Lizzy	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
others;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
half	1
so	1
handsome	1
as	1
Jane,	1
nor	1
half	1
so	1
good-humoured	1
as	1
Lydia.	1
But	1
you	1
are	1
always	1
giving	1
_her_	1
the	1
preference."	1
"They	1
have	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
much	1
to	1
recommend	1
them,"	1
replied	1
he;	1
"they	1
are	1
all	1
silly	1
and	1
ignorant	1
like	1
other	1
girls;	1
but	1
Lizzy	1
has	1
something	1
more	1
of	1
quickness	1
than	1
her	1
sisters."	1
"Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
how	1
_can_	1
you	1
abuse	1
your	1
own	1
children	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way?	1
You	1
take	1
delight	1
in	1
vexing	1
me.	1
You	1
have	1
no	1
compassion	1
for	1
my	1
poor	1
nerves."	1
"You	1
mistake	1
me,	1
my	1
dear.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
high	1
respect	1
for	1
your	1
nerves.	1
They	1
are	1
my	1
old	1
friends.	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
you	1
mention	1
them	1
with	1
consideration	1
these	1
last	1
twenty	1
years	1
at	1
least."	1
"Ah,	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
suffer."	1
"But	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
get	1
over	1
it,	1
and	1
live	1
to	1
see	1
many	1
young	1
men	1
of	1
four	1
thousand	1
a	1
year	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
neighbourhood."	1
"It	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
use	1
to	1
us,	1
if	1
twenty	1
such	1
should	1
come,	1
since	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
visit	1
them."	1
"Depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
my	1
dear,	1
that	1
when	1
there	1
are	1
twenty,	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
them	1
all."	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
so	1
odd	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
quick	1
parts,	1
sarcastic	1
humour,	1
reserve,	1
and	1
caprice,	1
that	1
the	1
experience	1
of	1
three-and-twenty	1
years	1
had	1
been	1
insufficient	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
wife	1
understand	1
his	1
character.	1
_Her_	1
mind	1
was	1
less	1
difficult	1
to	1
develop.	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
mean	1
understanding,	1
little	1
information,	1
and	1
uncertain	1
temper.	1
When	1
she	1
was	1
discontented,	1
she	1
fancied	1
herself	1
nervous.	1
The	1
business	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
was	1
to	1
get	1
her	1
daughters	1
married;	1
its	1
solace	1
was	1
visiting	1
and	1
news.	1
Chapter	1
2	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
among	1
the	1
earliest	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
waited	1
on	1
Mr.	1
Bingley.	1
He	1
had	1
always	1
intended	1
to	1
visit	1
him,	1
though	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
always	1
assuring	1
his	1
wife	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
go;	1
and	1
till	1
the	1
evening	1
after	1
the	1
visit	1
was	1
paid	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
knowledge	1
of	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
then	1
disclosed	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
manner.	1
Observing	1
his	1
second	1
daughter	1
employed	1
in	1
trimming	1
a	1
hat,	1
he	1
suddenly	1
addressed	1
her	1
with:	1
"I	1
hope	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
will	1
like	1
it,	1
Lizzy."	1
"We	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
know	1
_what_	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
likes,"	1
said	1
her	1
mother	1
resentfully,	1
"since	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
visit."	1
"But	1
you	1
forget,	1
mamma,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
"that	1
we	1
shall	1
meet	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
assemblies,	1
and	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Long	1
promised	1
to	1
introduce	1
him."	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
Mrs.	1
Long	1
will	1
do	1
any	1
such	1
thing.	1
She	1
has	1
two	1
nieces	1
of	1
her	1
own.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
selfish,	1
hypocritical	1
woman,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
opinion	1
of	1
her."	1
"No	1
more	1
have	1
I,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Bennet;	1
"and	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
depend	1
on	1
her	1
serving	1
you."	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
deigned	1
not	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
reply,	1
but,	1
unable	1
to	1
contain	1
herself,	1
began	1
scolding	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
daughters.	1
"Don't	1
keep	1
coughing	1
so,	1
Kitty,	1
for	1
Heaven's	1
sake!	1
Have	1
a	1
little	1
compassion	1
on	1
my	1
nerves.	1
You	1
tear	1
them	1
to	1
pieces."	1
"Kitty	1
has	1
no	1
discretion	1
in	1
her	1
coughs,"	1
said	1
her	1
father;	1
"she	1
times	1
them	1
ill."	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
cough	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
amusement,"	1
replied	1
Kitty	1
fretfully.	1
"When	1
is	1
your	1
next	1
ball	1
to	1
be,	1
Lizzy?"	1
"To-morrow	1
fortnight."	1
"Aye,	1
so	1
it	1
is,"	1
cried	1
her	1
mother,	1
"and	1
Mrs.	1
Long	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
back	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
before;	1
so	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
impossible	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
introduce	1
him,	1
for	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
know	1
him	1
herself."	1
"Then,	1
my	1
dear,	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
your	1
friend,	1
and	1
introduce	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
to	1
_her_."	1
"Impossible,	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
impossible,	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him	1
myself;	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
teasing?"	1
"I	1
honour	1
your	1
circumspection.	1
A	1
fortnight's	1
acquaintance	1
is	1
certainly	1
very	1
little.	1
One	1
cannot	1
know	1
what	1
a	1
man	1
really	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
fortnight.	1
But	1
if	1
_we_	1
do	1
not	1
venture	1
somebody	1
else	1
will;	1
and	1
after	1
all,	1
Mrs.	1
Long	1
and	1
her	1
daughters	1
must	1
stand	1
their	1
chance;	1
and,	1
therefore,	1
as	1
she	1
will	1
think	1
it	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
kindness,	1
if	1
you	1
decline	1
the	1
office,	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
on	1
myself."	1
The	1
girls	1
stared	1
at	1
their	1
father.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
said	1
only,	1
"Nonsense,	1
nonsense!"	1
"What	1
can	1
be	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
that	1
emphatic	1
exclamation?"	1
cried	1
he.	1
"Do	1
you	1
consider	1
the	1
forms	1
of	1
introduction,	1
and	1
the	1
stress	1
that	1
is	1
laid	1
on	1
them,	1
as	1
nonsense?	1
I	1
cannot	1
quite	1
agree	1
with	1
you	1
_there_.	1
What	1
say	1
you,	1
Mary?	1
For	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
of	1
deep	1
reflection,	1
I	1
know,	1
and	1
read	1
great	1
books	1
and	1
make	1
extracts."	1
Mary	1
wished	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
sensible,	1
but	1
knew	1
not	1
how.	1
"While	1
Mary	1
is	1
adjusting	1
her	1
ideas,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"let	1
us	1
return	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Bingley."	1
"I	1
am	1
sick	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,"	1
cried	1
his	1
wife.	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
hear	1
_that_;	1
but	1
why	1
did	1
not	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
before?	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
known	1
as	1
much	1
this	1
morning	1
I	1
certainly	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
called	1
on	1
him.	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
unlucky;	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
actually	1
paid	1
the	1
visit,	1
we	1
cannot	1
escape	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
now."	1
The	1
astonishment	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
he	1
wished;	1
that	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
perhaps	1
surpassing	1
the	1
rest;	1
though,	1
when	1
the	1
first	1
tumult	1
of	1
joy	1
was	1
over,	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
declare	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
expected	1
all	1
the	1
while.	1
"How	1
good	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
you,	1
my	1
dear	1
Mr.	1
Bennet!	1
But	1
I	1
knew	1
I	1
should	1
persuade	1
you	1
at	1
last.	1
I	1
was	1
sure	1
you	1
loved	1
your	1
girls	1
too	1
well	1
to	1
neglect	1
such	1
an	1
acquaintance.	1
Well,	1
how	1
pleased	1
I	1
am!	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
joke,	1
too,	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
gone	1
this	1
morning	1
and	1
never	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
it	1
till	1
now."	1
"Now,	1
Kitty,	1
you	1
may	1
cough	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
choose,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Bennet;	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
spoke,	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
room,	1
fatigued	1
with	1
the	1
raptures	1
of	1
his	1
wife.	1
"What	1
an	1
excellent	1
father	1
you	1
have,	1
girls!"	1
said	1
she,	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
shut.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
you	1
will	1
ever	1
make	1
him	1
amends	1
for	1
his	1
kindness;	1
or	1
me,	1
either,	1
for	1
that	1
matter.	1
At	1
our	1
time	1
of	1
life	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
pleasant,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,	1
to	1
be	1
making	1
new	1
acquaintances	1
every	1
day;	1
but	1
for	1
your	1
sakes,	1
we	1
would	1
do	1
anything.	1
Lydia,	1
my	1
love,	1
though	1
you	1
_are_	1
the	1
youngest,	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
will	1
dance	1
with	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
ball."	1
"Oh!"	1
said	1
Lydia	1
stoutly,	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
afraid;	1
for	1
though	1
I	1
_am_	1
the	1
youngest,	1
I'm	1
the	1
tallest."	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
was	1
spent	1
in	1
conjecturing	1
how	1
soon	1
he	1
would	1
return	1
Mr.	1
Bennet's	1
visit,	1
and	1
determining	1
when	1
they	1
should	1
ask	1
him	1
to	1
dinner.	1
Chapter	1
3	1
Not	1
all	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
however,	1
with	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
her	1
five	1
daughters,	1
could	1
ask	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
was	1
sufficient	1
to	1
draw	1
from	1
her	1
husband	1
any	1
satisfactory	1
description	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Bingley.	1
They	1
attacked	1
him	1
in	1
various	1
ways--with	1
barefaced	1
questions,	1
ingenious	1
suppositions,	1
and	1
distant	1
surmises;	1
but	1
he	1
eluded	1
the	1
skill	1
of	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
last	1
obliged	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
second-hand	1
intelligence	1
of	1
their	1
neighbour,	1
Lady	1
Lucas.	1
Her	1
report	1
was	1
highly	1
favourable.	1
Sir	1
William	1
had	1
been	1
delighted	1
with	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
quite	1
young,	1
wonderfully	1
handsome,	1
extremely	1
agreeable,	1
and,	1
to	1
crown	1
the	1
whole,	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
assembly	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
party.	1
Nothing	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
delightful!	1
To	1
be	1
fond	1
of	1
dancing	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
step	1
towards	1
falling	1
in	1
love;	1
and	1
very	1
lively	1
hopes	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
heart	1
were	1
entertained.	1
"If	1
I	1
can	1
but	1
see	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
daughters	1
happily	1
settled	1
at	1
Netherfield,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
to	1
her	1
husband,	1
"and	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
equally	1
well	1
married,	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
wish	1
for."	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
returned	1
Mr.	1
Bennet's	1
visit,	1
and	1
sat	1
about	1
ten	1
minutes	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
library.	1
He	1
had	1
entertained	1
hopes	1
of	1
being	1
admitted	1
to	1
a	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
ladies,	1
of	1
whose	1
beauty	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
much;	1
but	1
he	1
saw	1
only	1
the	1
father.	1
The	1
ladies	1
were	1
somewhat	1
more	1
fortunate,	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
ascertaining	1
from	1
an	1
upper	1
window	1
that	1
he	1
wore	1
a	1
blue	1
coat,	1
and	1
rode	1
a	1
black	1
horse.	1
An	1
invitation	1
to	1
dinner	1
was	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
dispatched;	1
and	1
already	1
had	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
planned	1
the	1
courses	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
do	1
credit	1
to	1
her	1
housekeeping,	1
when	1
an	1
answer	1
arrived	1
which	1
deferred	1
it	1
all.	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
town	1
the	1
following	1
day,	1
and,	1
consequently,	1
unable	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
their	1
invitation,	1
etc.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
quite	1
disconcerted.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
what	1
business	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
in	1
town	1
so	1
soon	1
after	1
his	1
arrival	1
in	1
Hertfordshire;	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
fear	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
always	1
flying	1
about	1
from	1
one	1
place	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
never	1
settled	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
as	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be.	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
quieted	1
her	1
fears	1
a	1
little	1
by	1
starting	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
gone	1
to	1
London	1
only	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
large	1
party	1
for	1
the	1
ball;	1
and	1
a	1
report	1
soon	1
followed	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
was	1
to	1
bring	1
twelve	1
ladies	1
and	1
seven	1
gentlemen	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
assembly.	1
The	1
girls	1
grieved	1
over	1
such	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
ladies,	1
but	1
were	1
comforted	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
the	1
ball	1
by	1
hearing,	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
twelve	1
he	1
brought	1
only	1
six	1
with	1
him	1
from	1
London--his	1
five	1
sisters	1
and	1
a	1
cousin.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
party	1
entered	1
the	1
assembly	1
room	1
it	1
consisted	1
of	1
only	1
five	1
altogether--Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
his	1
two	1
sisters,	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
the	1
eldest,	1
and	1
another	1
young	1
man.	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
was	1
good-looking	1
and	1
gentlemanlike;	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
pleasant	1
countenance,	1
and	1
easy,	1
unaffected	1
manners.	1
His	1
sisters	1
were	1
fine	1
women,	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
decided	1
fashion.	1
His	1
brother-in-law,	1
Mr.	1
Hurst,	1
merely	1
looked	1
the	1
gentleman;	1
but	1
his	1
friend	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
soon	1
drew	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
by	1
his	1
fine,	1
tall	1
person,	1
handsome	1
features,	1
noble	1
mien,	1
and	1
the	1
report	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
general	1
circulation	1
within	1
five	1
minutes	1
after	1
his	1
entrance,	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
ten	1
thousand	1
a	1
year.	1
The	1
gentlemen	1
pronounced	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
fine	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
man,	1
the	1
ladies	1
declared	1
he	1
was	1
much	1
handsomer	1
than	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
looked	1
at	1
with	1
great	1
admiration	1
for	1
about	1
half	1
the	1
evening,	1
till	1
his	1
manners	1
gave	1
a	1
disgust	1
which	1
turned	1
the	1
tide	1
of	1
his	1
popularity;	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
discovered	1
to	1
be	1
proud;	1
to	1
be	1
above	1
his	1
company,	1
and	1
above	1
being	1
pleased;	1
and	1
not	1
all	1
his	1
large	1
estate	1
in	1
Derbyshire	1
could	1
then	1
save	1
him	1
from	1
having	1
a	1
most	1
forbidding,	1
disagreeable	1
countenance,	1
and	1
being	1
unworthy	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
with	1
his	1
friend.	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
had	1
soon	1
made	1
himself	1
acquainted	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
principal	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
room;	1
he	1
was	1
lively	1
and	1
unreserved,	1
danced	1
every	1
dance,	1
was	1
angry	1
that	1
the	1
ball	1
closed	1
so	1
early,	1
and	1
talked	1
of	1
giving	1
one	1
himself	1
at	1
Netherfield.	1
Such	1
amiable	1
qualities	1
must	1
speak	1
for	1
themselves.	1
What	1
a	1
contrast	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
friend!	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
danced	1
only	1
once	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst	1
and	1
once	1
with	1
Miss	1
Bingley,	1
declined	1
being	1
introduced	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
lady,	1
and	1
spent	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
in	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
room,	1
speaking	1
occasionally	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
party.	1
His	1
character	1
was	1
decided.	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
proudest,	1
most	1
disagreeable	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
everybody	1
hoped	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
come	1
there	1
again.	1
Amongst	1
the	1
most	1
violent	1
against	1
him	1
was	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
whose	1
dislike	1
of	1
his	1
general	1
behaviour	1
was	1
sharpened	1
into	1
particular	1
resentment	1
by	1
his	1
having	1
slighted	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
daughters.	1
Elizabeth	1
Bennet	1
had	1
been	1
obliged,	1
by	1
the	1
scarcity	1
of	1
gentlemen,	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
for	1
two	1
dances;	1
and	1
during	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
time,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
had	1
been	1
standing	1
near	1
enough	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
hear	1
a	1
conversation	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
who	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
dance	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
to	1
press	1
his	1
friend	1
to	1
join	1
it.	1
"Come,	1
Darcy,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"I	1
must	1
have	1
you	1
dance.	1
I	1
hate	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
standing	1
about	1
by	1
yourself	1
in	1
this	1
stupid	1
manner.	1
You	1
had	1
much	1
better	1
dance."	1
"I	1
certainly	1
shall	1
not.	1
You	1
know	1
how	1
I	1
detest	1
it,	1
unless	1
I	1
am	1
particularly	1
acquainted	1
with	1
my	1
partner.	1
At	1
such	1
an	1
assembly	1
as	1
this	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
insupportable.	1
Your	1
sisters	1
are	1
engaged,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
another	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
whom	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
punishment	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
stand	1
up	1
with."	1
"I	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
fastidious	1
as	1
you	1
are,"	1
cried	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
"for	1
a	1
kingdom!	1
Upon	1
my	1
honour,	1
I	1
never	1
met	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
pleasant	1
girls	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
this	1
evening;	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
several	1
of	1
them	1
you	1
see	1
uncommonly	1
pretty."	1
"_You_	1
are	1
dancing	1
with	1
the	1
only	1
handsome	1
girl	1
in	1
the	1
room,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
eldest	1
Miss	1
Bennet.	1
"Oh!	1
She	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
creature	1
I	1
ever	1
beheld!	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
sisters	1
sitting	1
down	1
just	1
behind	1
you,	1
who	1
is	1
very	1
pretty,	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
very	1
agreeable.	1
Do	1
let	1
me	1
ask	1
my	1
partner	1
to	1
introduce	1
you."	1
"Which	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
and	1
turning	1
round	1
he	1
looked	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
at	1
Elizabeth,	1
till	1
catching	1
her	1
eye,	1
he	1
withdrew	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
coldly	1
said:	1
"She	1
is	1
tolerable,	1
but	1
not	1
handsome	1
enough	1
to	1
tempt	1
_me_;	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
no	1
humour	1
at	1
present	1
to	1
give	1
consequence	1
to	1
young	1
ladies	1
who	1
are	1
slighted	1
by	1
other	1
men.	1
You	1
had	1
better	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
partner	1
and	1
enjoy	1
her	1
smiles,	1
for	1
you	1
are	1
wasting	1
your	1
time	1
with	1
me."	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
followed	1
his	1
advice.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
walked	1
off;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
remained	1
with	1
no	1
very	1
cordial	1
feelings	1
toward	1
him.	1
She	1
told	1
the	1
story,	1
however,	1
with	1
great	1
spirit	1
among	1
her	1
friends;	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
lively,	1
playful	1
disposition,	1
which	1
delighted	1
in	1
anything	1
ridiculous.	1
The	1
evening	1
altogether	1
passed	1
off	1
pleasantly	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
family.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
much	1
admired	1
by	1
the	1
Netherfield	1
party.	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
had	1
danced	1
with	1
her	1
twice,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
distinguished	1
by	1
his	1
sisters.	1
Jane	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
gratified	1
by	1
this	1
as	1
her	1
mother	1
could	1
be,	1
though	1
in	1
a	1
quieter	1
way.	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
Jane's	1
pleasure.	1
Mary	1
had	1
heard	1
herself	1
mentioned	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
accomplished	1
girl	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood;	1
and	1
Catherine	1
and	1
Lydia	1
had	1
been	1
fortunate	1
enough	1
never	1
to	1
be	1
without	1
partners,	1
which	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
yet	1
learnt	1
to	1
care	1
for	1
at	1
a	1
ball.	1
They	1
returned,	1
therefore,	1
in	1
good	1
spirits	1
to	1
Longbourn,	1
the	1
village	1
where	1
they	1
lived,	1
and	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
principal	1
inhabitants.	1
They	1
found	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
still	1
up.	1
With	1
a	1
book	1
he	1
was	1
regardless	1
of	1
time;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
present	1
occasion	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
curiosity	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
an	1
evening	1
which	1
had	1
raised	1
such	1
splendid	1
expectations.	1
He	1
had	1
rather	1
hoped	1
that	1
his	1
wife's	1
views	1
on	1
the	1
stranger	1
would	1
be	1
disappointed;	1
but	1
he	1
soon	1
found	1
out	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
different	1
story	1
to	1
hear.	1
"Oh!	1
my	1
dear	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,"	1
as	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
room,	1
"we	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
most	1
delightful	1
evening,	1
a	1
most	1
excellent	1
ball.	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
there.	1
Jane	1
was	1
so	1
admired,	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
like	1
it.	1
Everybody	1
said	1
how	1
well	1
she	1
looked;	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
thought	1
her	1
quite	1
beautiful,	1
and	1
danced	1
with	1
her	1
twice!	1
Only	1
think	1
of	1
_that_,	1
my	1
dear;	1
he	1
actually	1
danced	1
with	1
her	1
twice!	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
that	1
he	1
asked	1
a	1
second	1
time.	1
First	1
of	1
all,	1
he	1
asked	1
Miss	1
Lucas.	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
vexed	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
stand	1
up	1
with	1
her!	1
But,	1
however,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
admire	1
her	1
at	1
all;	1
indeed,	1
nobody	1
can,	1
you	1
know;	1
and	1
he	1
seemed	1
quite	1
struck	1
with	1
Jane	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
down	1
the	1
dance.	1
So	1
he	1
inquired	1
who	1
she	1
was,	1
and	1
got	1
introduced,	1
and	1
asked	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
two	1
next.	1
Then	1
the	1
two	1
third	1
he	1
danced	1
with	1
Miss	1
King,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fourth	1
with	1
Maria	1
Lucas,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
fifth	1
with	1
Jane	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
sixth	1
with	1
Lizzy,	1
and	1
the	1
_Boulanger_--"	1
"If	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
any	1
compassion	1
for	1
_me_,"	1
cried	1
her	1
husband	1
impatiently,	1
"he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
danced	1
half	1
so	1
much!	1
For	1
God's	1
sake,	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
his	1
partners.	1
Oh	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
sprained	1
his	1
ankle	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
dance!"	1
"Oh!	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
am	1
quite	1
delighted	1
with	1
him.	1
He	1
is	1
so	1
excessively	1
handsome!	1
And	1
his	1
sisters	1
are	1
charming	1
women.	1
I	1
never	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
saw	1
anything	1
more	1
elegant	1
than	1
their	1
dresses.	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
the	1
lace	1
upon	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst's	1
gown--"	1
Here	1
she	1
was	1
interrupted	1
again.	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
protested	1
against	1
any	1
description	1
of	1
finery.	1
She	1
was	1
therefore	1
obliged	1
to	1
seek	1
another	1
branch	1
of	1
the	1
subject,	1
and	1
related,	1
with	1
much	1
bitterness	1
of	1
spirit	1
and	1
some	1
exaggeration,	1
the	1
shocking	1
rudeness	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy.	1
"But	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
you,"	1
she	1
added,	1
"that	1
Lizzy	1
does	1
not	1
lose	1
much	1
by	1
not	1
suiting	1
_his_	1
fancy;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
disagreeable,	1
horrid	1
man,	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
worth	1
pleasing.	1
So	1
high	1
and	1
so	1
conceited	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
enduring	1
him!	1
He	1
walked	1
here,	1
and	1
he	1
walked	1
there,	1
fancying	1
himself	1
so	1
very	1
great!	1
Not	1
handsome	1
enough	1
to	1
dance	1
with!	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
there,	1
my	1
dear,	1
to	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
set-downs.	1
I	1
quite	1
detest	1
the	1
man."	1
Chapter	1
4	1
When	1
Jane	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
were	1
alone,	1
the	1
former,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
cautious	1
in	1
her	1
praise	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
before,	1
expressed	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
just	1
how	1
very	1
much	1
she	1
admired	1
him.	1
"He	1
is	1
just	1
what	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
ought	1
to	1
be,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"sensible,	1
good-humoured,	1
lively;	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
such	1
happy	1
manners!--so	1
much	1
ease,	1
with	1
such	1
perfect	1
good	1
breeding!"	1
"He	1
is	1
also	1
handsome,"	1
replied	1
Elizabeth,	1
"which	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
ought	1
likewise	1
to	1
be,	1
if	1
he	1
possibly	1
can.	1
His	1
character	1
is	1
thereby	1
complete."	1
"I	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
flattered	1
by	1
his	1
asking	1
me	1
to	1
dance	1
a	1
second	1
time.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
such	1
a	1
compliment."	1
"Did	1
not	1
you?	1
I	1
did	1
for	1
you.	1
But	1
that	1
is	1
one	1
great	1
difference	1
between	1
us.	1
Compliments	1
always	1
take	1
_you_	1
by	1
surprise,	1
and	1
_me_	1
never.	1
What	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
natural	1
than	1
his	1
asking	1
you	1
again?	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
seeing	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
about	1
five	1
times	1
as	1
pretty	1
as	1
every	1
other	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
No	1
thanks	1
to	1
his	1
gallantry	1
for	1
that.	1
Well,	1
he	1
certainly	1
is	1
very	1
agreeable,	1
and	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
leave	1
to	1
like	1
him.	1
You	1
have	1
liked	1
many	1
a	1
stupider	1
person."	1
"Dear	1
Lizzy!"	1
"Oh!	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
apt,	1
you	1
know,	1
to	1
like	1
people	1
in	1
general.	1
You	1
never	1
see	1
a	1
fault	1
in	1
anybody.	1
All	1
the	1
world	1
are	1
good	1
and	1
agreeable	1
in	1
your	1
eyes.	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
you	1
speak	1
ill	1
of	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
in	1
your	1
life."	1
"I	1
would	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
hasty	1
in	1
censuring	1
anyone;	1
but	1
I	1
always	1
speak	1
what	1
I	1
think."	1
"I	1
know	1
you	1
do;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
_that_	1
which	1
makes	1
the	1
wonder.	1
With	1
_your_	1
good	1
sense,	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
honestly	1
blind	1
to	1
the	1
follies	1
and	1
nonsense	1
of	1
others!	1
Affectation	1
of	1
candour	1
is	1
common	1
enough--one	1
meets	1
with	1
it	1
everywhere.	1
But	1
to	1
be	1
candid	1
without	1
ostentation	1
or	1
design--to	1
take	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
everybody's	1
character	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
still	1
better,	1
and	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
bad--belongs	1
to	1
you	1
alone.	1
And	1
so	1
you	1
like	1
this	1
man's	1
sisters,	1
too,	1
do	1
you?	1
Their	1
manners	1
are	1
not	1
equal	1
to	1
his."	1
"Certainly	1
not--at	1
first.	1
But	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
pleasing	1
women	1
when	1
you	1
converse	1
with	1
them.	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
is	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
her	1
brother,	1
and	1
keep	1
his	1
house;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
mistaken	1
if	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
a	1
very	1
charming	1
neighbour	1
in	1
her."	1
Elizabeth	1
listened	1
in	1
silence,	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
convinced;	1
their	1
behaviour	1
at	1
the	1
assembly	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
calculated	1
to	1
please	1
in	1
general;	1
and	1
with	1
more	1
quickness	1
of	1
observation	1
and	1
less	1
pliancy	1
of	1
temper	1
than	1
her	1
sister,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
judgement	1
too	1
unassailed	1
by	1
any	1
attention	1
to	1
herself,	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
little	1
disposed	1
to	1
approve	1
them.	1
They	1
were	1
in	1
fact	1
very	1
fine	1
ladies;	1
not	1
deficient	1
in	1
good	1
humour	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
pleased,	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
making	1
themselves	1
agreeable	1
when	1
they	1
chose	1
it,	1
but	1
proud	1
and	1
conceited.	1
They	1
were	1
rather	1
handsome,	1
had	1
been	1
educated	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
private	1
seminaries	1
in	1
town,	1
had	1
a	1
fortune	1
of	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
spending	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
ought,	1
and	1
of	1
associating	1
with	1
people	1
of	1
rank,	1
and	1
were	1
therefore	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
entitled	1
to	1
think	1
well	1
of	1
themselves,	1
and	1
meanly	1
of	1
others.	1
They	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
respectable	1
family	1
in	1
the	1
north	1
of	1
England;	1
a	1
circumstance	1
more	1
deeply	1
impressed	1
on	1
their	1
memories	1
than	1
that	1
their	1
brother's	1
fortune	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
had	1
been	1
acquired	1
by	1
trade.	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
inherited	1
property	1
to	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
nearly	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
from	1
his	1
father,	1
who	1
had	1
intended	1
to	1
purchase	1
an	1
estate,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
live	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
intended	1
it	1
likewise,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
made	1
choice	1
of	1
his	1
county;	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
provided	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
house	1
and	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
a	1
manor,	1
it	1
was	1
doubtful	1
to	1
many	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
best	1
knew	1
the	1
easiness	1
of	1
his	1
temper,	1
whether	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
spend	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
his	1
days	1
at	1
Netherfield,	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
next	1
generation	1
to	1
purchase.	1
His	1
sisters	1
were	1
anxious	1
for	1
his	1
having	1
an	1
estate	1
of	1
his	1
own;	1
but,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
only	1
established	1
as	1
a	1
tenant,	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
unwilling	1
to	1
preside	1
at	1
his	1
table--nor	1
was	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst,	1
who	1
had	1
married	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
more	1
fashion	1
than	1
fortune,	1
less	1
disposed	1
to	1
consider	1
his	1
house	1
as	1
her	1
home	1
when	1
it	1
suited	1
her.	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
of	1
age	1
two	1
years,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
tempted	1
by	1
an	1
accidental	1
recommendation	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
House.	1
He	1
did	1
look	1
at	1
it,	1
and	1
into	1
it	1
for	1
half-an-hour--was	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
situation	1
and	1
the	1
principal	1
rooms,	1
satisfied	1
with	1
what	1
the	1
owner	1
said	1
in	1
its	1
praise,	1
and	1
took	1
it	1
immediately.	1
Between	1
him	1
and	1
Darcy	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
steady	1
friendship,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
great	1
opposition	1
of	1
character.	1
Bingley	1
was	1
endeared	1
to	1
Darcy	1
by	1
the	1
easiness,	1
openness,	1
and	1
ductility	1
of	1
his	1
temper,	1
though	1
no	1
disposition	1
could	1
offer	1
a	1
greater	1
contrast	1
to	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
though	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
he	1
never	1
appeared	1
dissatisfied.	1
On	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
Darcy's	1
regard,	1
Bingley	1
had	1
the	1
firmest	1
reliance,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
judgement	1
the	1
highest	1
opinion.	1
In	1
understanding,	1
Darcy	1
was	1
the	1
superior.	1
Bingley	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
deficient,	1
but	1
Darcy	1
was	1
clever.	1
He	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
haughty,	1
reserved,	1
and	1
fastidious,	1
and	1
his	1
manners,	1
though	1
well-bred,	1
were	1
not	1
inviting.	1
In	1
that	1
respect	1
his	1
friend	1
had	1
greatly	1
the	1
advantage.	1
Bingley	1
was	1
sure	1
of	1
being	1
liked	1
wherever	1
he	1
appeared,	1
Darcy	1
was	1
continually	1
giving	1
offense.	1
The	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
Meryton	1
assembly	1
was	1
sufficiently	1
characteristic.	1
Bingley	1
had	1
never	1
met	1
with	1
more	1
pleasant	1
people	1
or	1
prettier	1
girls	1
in	1
his	1
life;	1
everybody	1
had	1
been	1
most	1
kind	1
and	1
attentive	1
to	1
him;	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
no	1
formality,	1
no	1
stiffness;	1
he	1
had	1
soon	1
felt	1
acquainted	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
room;	1
and,	1
as	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
conceive	1
an	1
angel	1
more	1
beautiful.	1
Darcy,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
had	1
seen	1
a	1
collection	1
of	1
people	1
in	1
whom	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
beauty	1
and	1
no	1
fashion,	1
for	1
none	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
the	1
smallest	1
interest,	1
and	1
from	1
none	1
received	1
either	1
attention	1
or	1
pleasure.	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
he	1
acknowledged	1
to	1
be	1
pretty,	1
but	1
she	1
smiled	1
too	1
much.	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
allowed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
so--but	1
still	1
they	1
admired	1
her	1
and	1
liked	1
her,	1
and	1
pronounced	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
sweet	1
girl,	1
and	1
one	1
whom	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
object	1
to	1
know	1
more	1
of.	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
was	1
therefore	1
established	1
as	1
a	1
sweet	1
girl,	1
and	1
their	1
brother	1
felt	1
authorized	1
by	1
such	1
commendation	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
chose.	1
Chapter	1
5	1
Within	1
a	1
short	1
walk	1
of	1
Longbourn	1
lived	1
a	1
family	1
with	1
whom	1
the	1
Bennets	1
were	1
particularly	1
intimate.	1
Sir	1
William	1
Lucas	1
had	1
been	1
formerly	1
in	1
trade	1
in	1
Meryton,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
tolerable	1
fortune,	1
and	1
risen	1
to	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
knighthood	1
by	1
an	1
address	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
during	1
his	1
mayoralty.	1
The	1
distinction	1
had	1
perhaps	1
been	1
felt	1
too	1
strongly.	1
It	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
disgust	1
to	1
his	1
business,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
residence	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
market	1
town;	1
and,	1
in	1
quitting	1
them	1
both,	1
he	1
had	1
removed	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
to	1
a	1
house	1
about	1
a	1
mile	1
from	1
Meryton,	1
denominated	1
from	1
that	1
period	1
Lucas	1
Lodge,	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
think	1
with	1
pleasure	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
importance,	1
and,	1
unshackled	1
by	1
business,	1
occupy	1
himself	1
solely	1
in	1
being	1
civil	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
world.	1
For,	1
though	1
elated	1
by	1
his	1
rank,	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
render	1
him	1
supercilious;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
was	1
all	1
attention	1
to	1
everybody.	1
By	1
nature	1
inoffensive,	1
friendly,	1
and	1
obliging,	1
his	1
presentation	1
at	1
St.	1
James's	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
courteous.	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
kind	1
of	1
woman,	1
not	1
too	1
clever	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
valuable	1
neighbour	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet.	1
They	1
had	1
several	1
children.	1
The	1
eldest	1
of	1
them,	1
a	1
sensible,	1
intelligent	1
young	1
woman,	1
about	1
twenty-seven,	1
was	1
Elizabeth's	1
intimate	1
friend.	1
That	1
the	1
Miss	1
Lucases	1
and	1
the	1
Miss	1
Bennets	1
should	1
meet	1
to	1
talk	1
over	1
a	1
ball	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary;	1
and	1
the	1
morning	1
after	1
the	1
assembly	1
brought	1
the	1
former	1
to	1
Longbourn	1
to	1
hear	1
and	1
to	1
communicate.	1
"_You_	1
began	1
the	1
evening	1
well,	1
Charlotte,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
with	1
civil	1
self-command	1
to	1
Miss	1
Lucas.	1
"_You_	1
were	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
first	1
choice."	1
"Yes;	1
but	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
like	1
his	1
second	1
better."	1
"Oh!	1
you	1
mean	1
Jane,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
because	1
he	1
danced	1
with	1
her	1
twice.	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
_did_	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
admired	1
her--indeed	1
I	1
rather	1
believe	1
he	1
_did_--I	1
heard	1
something	1
about	1
it--but	1
I	1
hardly	1
know	1
what--something	1
about	1
Mr.	1
Robinson."	1
"Perhaps	1
you	1
mean	1
what	1
I	1
overheard	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Robinson;	1
did	1
not	1
I	1
mention	1
it	1
to	1
you?	1
Mr.	1
Robinson's	1
asking	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
liked	1
our	1
Meryton	1
assemblies,	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
pretty	1
women	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
_which_	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
prettiest?	1
and	1
his	1
answering	1
immediately	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
question:	1
'Oh!	1
the	1
eldest	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt;	1
there	1
cannot	1
be	1
two	1
opinions	1
on	1
that	1
point.'"	1
"Upon	1
my	1
word!	1
Well,	1
that	1
is	1
very	1
decided	1
indeed--that	1
does	1
seem	1
as	1
if--but,	1
however,	1
it	1
may	1
all	1
come	1
to	1
nothing,	1
you	1
know."	1
"_My_	1
overhearings	1
were	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
than	1
_yours_,	1
Eliza,"	1
said	1
Charlotte.	1
"Mr.	1
Darcy	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
well	1
worth	1
listening	1
to	1
as	1
his	1
friend,	1
is	1
he?--poor	1
Eliza!--to	1
be	1
only	1
just	1
_tolerable_."	1
"I	1
beg	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
Lizzy's	1
head	1
to	1
be	1
vexed	1
by	1
his	1
ill-treatment,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
man,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
a	1
misfortune	1
to	1
be	1
liked	1
by	1
him.	1
Mrs.	1
Long	1
told	1
me	1
last	1
night	1
that	1
he	1
sat	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
half-an-hour	1
without	1
once	1
opening	1
his	1
lips."	1
"Are	1
you	1
quite	1
sure,	1
ma'am?--is	1
not	1
there	1
a	1
little	1
mistake?"	1
said	1
Jane.	1
"I	1
certainly	1
saw	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
speaking	1
to	1
her."	1
"Aye--because	1
she	1
asked	1
him	1
at	1
last	1
how	1
he	1
liked	1
Netherfield,	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
answering	1
her;	1
but	1
she	1
said	1
he	1
seemed	1
quite	1
angry	1
at	1
being	1
spoke	1
to."	1
"Miss	1
Bingley	1
told	1
me,"	1
said	1
Jane,	1
"that	1
he	1
never	1
speaks	1
much,	1
unless	1
among	1
his	1
intimate	1
acquaintances.	1
With	1
_them_	1
he	1
is	1
remarkably	1
agreeable."	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
it,	1
my	1
dear.	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
very	1
agreeable,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
talked	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Long.	1
But	1
I	1
can	1
guess	1
how	1
it	1
was;	1
everybody	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
eat	1
up	1
with	1
pride,	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
somehow	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Long	1
does	1
not	1
keep	1
a	1
carriage,	1
and	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
ball	1
in	1
a	1
hack	1
chaise."	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
mind	1
his	1
not	1
talking	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Long,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Lucas,	1
"but	1
I	1
wish	1
he	1
had	1
danced	1
with	1
Eliza."	1
"Another	1
time,	1
Lizzy,"	1
said	1
her	1
mother,	1
"I	1
would	1
not	1
dance	1
with	1
_him_,	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
you."	1
"I	1
believe,	1
ma'am,	1
I	1
may	1
safely	1
promise	1
you	1
_never_	1
to	1
dance	1
with	1
him."	1
"His	1
pride,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Lucas,	1
"does	1
not	1
offend	1
_me_	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
pride	1
often	1
does,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
excuse	1
for	1
it.	1
One	1
cannot	1
wonder	1
that	1
so	1
very	1
fine	1
a	1
young	1
man,	1
with	1
family,	1
fortune,	1
everything	1
in	1
his	1
favour,	1
should	1
think	1
highly	1
of	1
himself.	1
If	1
I	1
may	1
so	1
express	1
it,	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
_right_	1
to	1
be	1
proud."	1
"That	1
is	1
very	1
true,"	1
replied	1
Elizabeth,	1
"and	1
I	1
could	1
easily	1
forgive	1
_his_	1
pride,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
mortified	1
_mine_."	1
"Pride,"	1
observed	1
Mary,	1
who	1
piqued	1
herself	1
upon	1
the	1
solidity	1
of	1
her	1
reflections,	1
"is	1
a	1
very	1
common	1
failing,	1
I	1
believe.	1
By	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
read,	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
common	1
indeed;	1
that	1
human	1
nature	1
is	1
particularly	1
prone	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
very	1
few	1
of	1
us	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
cherish	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
self-complacency	1
on	1
the	1
score	1
of	1
some	1
quality	1
or	1
other,	1
real	1
or	1
imaginary.	1
Vanity	1
and	1
pride	1
are	1
different	1
things,	1
though	1
the	1
words	1
are	1
often	1
used	1
synonymously.	1
A	1
person	1
may	1
be	1
proud	1
without	1
being	1
vain.	1
Pride	1
relates	1
more	1
to	1
our	1
opinion	1
of	1
ourselves,	1
vanity	1
to	1
what	1
we	1
would	1
have	1
others	1
think	1
of	1
us."	1
"If	1
I	1
were	1
as	1
rich	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,"	1
cried	1
a	1
young	1
Lucas,	1
who	1
came	1
with	1
his	1
sisters,	1
"I	1
should	1
not	1
care	1
how	1
proud	1
I	1
was.	1
I	1
would	1
keep	1
a	1
pack	1
of	1
foxhounds,	1
and	1
drink	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
wine	1
a	1
day."	1
"Then	1
you	1
would	1
drink	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
than	1
you	1
ought,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet;	1
"and	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
at	1
it,	1
I	1
should	1
take	1
away	1
your	1
bottle	1
directly."	1
The	1
boy	1
protested	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
not;	1
she	1
continued	1
to	1
declare	1
that	1
she	1
would,	1
and	1
the	1
argument	1
ended	1
only	1
with	1
the	1
visit.	1
Chapter	1
6	1
The	1
ladies	1
of	1
Longbourn	1
soon	1
waited	1
on	1
those	1
of	1
Netherfield.	1
The	1
visit	1
was	1
soon	1
returned	1
in	1
due	1
form.	1
Miss	1
Bennet's	1
pleasing	1
manners	1
grew	1
on	1
the	1
goodwill	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bingley;	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
mother	1
was	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
intolerable,	1
and	1
the	1
younger	1
sisters	1
not	1
worth	1
speaking	1
to,	1
a	1
wish	1
of	1
being	1
better	1
acquainted	1
with	1
_them_	1
was	1
expressed	1
towards	1
the	1
two	1
eldest.	1
By	1
Jane,	1
this	1
attention	1
was	1
received	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
pleasure,	1
but	1
Elizabeth	1
still	1
saw	1
superciliousness	1
in	1
their	1
treatment	1
of	1
everybody,	1
hardly	1
excepting	1
even	1
her	1
sister,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
like	1
them;	1
though	1
their	1
kindness	1
to	1
Jane,	1
such	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
had	1
a	1
value	1
as	1
arising	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
from	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
their	1
brother's	1
admiration.	1
It	1
was	1
generally	1
evident	1
whenever	1
they	1
met,	1
that	1
he	1
_did_	1
admire	1
her	1
and	1
to	1
_her_	1
it	1
was	1
equally	1
evident	1
that	1
Jane	1
was	1
yielding	1
to	1
the	1
preference	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
entertain	1
for	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
love;	1
but	1
she	1
considered	1
with	1
pleasure	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
discovered	1
by	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
general,	1
since	1
Jane	1
united,	1
with	1
great	1
strength	1
of	1
feeling,	1
a	1
composure	1
of	1
temper	1
and	1
a	1
uniform	1
cheerfulness	1
of	1
manner	1
which	1
would	1
guard	1
her	1
from	1
the	1
suspicions	1
of	1
the	1
impertinent.	1
She	1
mentioned	1
this	1
to	1
her	1
friend	1
Miss	1
Lucas.	1
"It	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
pleasant,"	1
replied	1
Charlotte,	1
"to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
impose	1
on	1
the	1
public	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
case;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
sometimes	1
a	1
disadvantage	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
very	1
guarded.	1
If	1
a	1
woman	1
conceals	1
her	1
affection	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
skill	1
from	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
it,	1
she	1
may	1
lose	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
fixing	1
him;	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
then	1
be	1
but	1
poor	1
consolation	1
to	1
believe	1
the	1
world	1
equally	1
in	1
the	1
dark.	1
There	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
gratitude	1
or	1
vanity	1
in	1
almost	1
every	1
attachment,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
safe	1
to	1
leave	1
any	1
to	1
itself.	1
We	1
can	1
all	1
_begin_	1
freely--a	1
slight	1
preference	1
is	1
natural	1
enough;	1
but	1
there	1
are	1
very	1
few	1
of	1
us	1
who	1
have	1
heart	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
really	1
in	1
love	1
without	1
encouragement.	1
In	1
nine	1
cases	1
out	1
of	1
ten	1
a	1
women	1
had	1
better	1
show	1
_more_	1
affection	1
than	1
she	1
feels.	1
Bingley	1
likes	1
your	1
sister	1
undoubtedly;	1
but	1
he	1
may	1
never	1
do	1
more	1
than	1
like	1
her,	1
if	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
help	1
him	1
on."	1
"But	1
she	1
does	1
help	1
him	1
on,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
her	1
nature	1
will	1
allow.	1
If	1
I	1
can	1
perceive	1
her	1
regard	1
for	1
him,	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
simpleton,	1
indeed,	1
not	1
to	1
discover	1
it	1
too."	1
"Remember,	1
Eliza,	1
that	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
Jane's	1
disposition	1
as	1
you	1
do."	1
"But	1
if	1
a	1
woman	1
is	1
partial	1
to	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
endeavour	1
to	1
conceal	1
it,	1
he	1
must	1
find	1
it	1
out."	1
"Perhaps	1
he	1
must,	1
if	1
he	1
sees	1
enough	1
of	1
her.	1
But,	1
though	1
Bingley	1
and	1
Jane	1
meet	1
tolerably	1
often,	1
it	1
is	1
never	1
for	1
many	1
hours	1
together;	1
and,	1
as	1
they	1
always	1
see	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
large	1
mixed	1
parties,	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
that	1
every	1
moment	1
should	1
be	1
employed	1
in	1
conversing	1
together.	1
Jane	1
should	1
therefore	1
make	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
every	1
half-hour	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
can	1
command	1
his	1
attention.	1
When	1
she	1
is	1
secure	1
of	1
him,	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
leisure	1
for	1
falling	1
in	1
love	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
chooses."	1
"Your	1
plan	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
one,"	1
replied	1
Elizabeth,	1
"where	1
nothing	1
is	1
in	1
question	1
but	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
being	1
well	1
married,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
determined	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
rich	1
husband,	1
or	1
any	1
husband,	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
I	1
should	1
adopt	1
it.	1
But	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
Jane's	1
feelings;	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
acting	1
by	1
design.	1
As	1
yet,	1
she	1
cannot	1
even	1
be	1
certain	1
of	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
regard	1
nor	1
of	1
its	1
reasonableness.	1
She	1
has	1
known	1
him	1
only	1
a	1
fortnight.	1
She	1
danced	1
four	1
dances	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
Meryton;	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
one	1
morning	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
and	1
has	1
since	1
dined	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
company	1
four	1
times.	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
quite	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
understand	1
his	1
character."	1
"Not	1
as	1
you	1
represent	1
it.	1
Had	1
she	1
merely	1
_dined_	1
with	1
him,	1
she	1
might	1
only	1
have	1
discovered	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
appetite;	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
remember	1
that	1
four	1
evenings	1
have	1
also	1
been	1
spent	1
together--and	1
four	1
evenings	1
may	1
do	1
a	1
great	1
deal."	1
"Yes;	1
these	1
four	1
evenings	1
have	1
enabled	1
them	1
to	1
ascertain	1
that	1
they	1
both	1
like	1
Vingt-un	1
better	1
than	1
Commerce;	1
but	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
leading	1
characteristic,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
imagine	1
that	1
much	1
has	1
been	1
unfolded."	1
"Well,"	1
said	1
Charlotte,	1
"I	1
wish	1
Jane	1
success	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart;	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
married	1
to	1
him	1
to-morrow,	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
she	1
had	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
happiness	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
studying	1
his	1
character	1
for	1
a	1
twelvemonth.	1
Happiness	1
in	1
marriage	1
is	1
entirely	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
chance.	1
If	1
the	1
dispositions	1
of	1
the	1
parties	1
are	1
ever	1
so	1
well	1
known	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
or	1
ever	1
so	1
similar	1
beforehand,	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
advance	1
their	1
felicity	1
in	1
the	1
least.	1
They	1
always	1
continue	1
to	1
grow	1
sufficiently	1
unlike	1
afterwards	1
to	1
have	1
their	1
share	1
of	1
vexation;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
know	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
possible	1
of	1
the	1
defects	1
of	1
the	1
person	1
with	1
whom	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
pass	1
your	1
life."	1
"You	1
make	1
me	1
laugh,	1
Charlotte;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
sound.	1
You	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
sound,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
never	1
act	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
yourself."	1
Occupied	1
in	1
observing	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
attentions	1
to	1
her	1
sister,	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
far	1
from	1
suspecting	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
herself	1
becoming	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
some	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
his	1
friend.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
scarcely	1
allowed	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
pretty;	1
he	1
had	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
without	1
admiration	1
at	1
the	1
ball;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
next	1
met,	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
only	1
to	1
criticise.	1
But	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
he	1
made	1
it	1
clear	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
friends	1
that	1
she	1
hardly	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
feature	1
in	1
her	1
face,	1
than	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
was	1
rendered	1
uncommonly	1
intelligent	1
by	1
the	1
beautiful	1
expression	1
of	1
her	1
dark	1
eyes.	1
To	1
this	1
discovery	1
succeeded	1
some	1
others	1
equally	1
mortifying.	1
Though	1
he	1
had	1
detected	1
with	1
a	1
critical	1
eye	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
failure	1
of	1
perfect	1
symmetry	1
in	1
her	1
form,	1
he	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
her	1
figure	1
to	1
be	1
light	1
and	1
pleasing;	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
asserting	1
that	1
her	1
manners	1
were	1
not	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
fashionable	1
world,	1
he	1
was	1
caught	1
by	1
their	1
easy	1
playfulness.	1
Of	1
this	1
she	1
was	1
perfectly	1
unaware;	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
made	1
himself	1
agreeable	1
nowhere,	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
her	1
handsome	1
enough	1
to	1
dance	1
with.	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
know	1
more	1
of	1
her,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
step	1
towards	1
conversing	1
with	1
her	1
himself,	1
attended	1
to	1
her	1
conversation	1
with	1
others.	1
His	1
doing	1
so	1
drew	1
her	1
notice.	1
It	1
was	1
at	1
Sir	1
William	1
Lucas's,	1
where	1
a	1
large	1
party	1
were	1
assembled.	1
"What	1
does	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
mean,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
Charlotte,	1
"by	1
listening	1
to	1
my	1
conversation	1
with	1
Colonel	1
Forster?"	1
"That	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
which	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
only	1
can	1
answer."	1
"But	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
it	1
any	1
more	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
about.	1
He	1
has	1
a	1
very	1
satirical	1
eye,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
begin	1
by	1
being	1
impertinent	1
myself,	1
I	1
shall	1
soon	1
grow	1
afraid	1
of	1
him."	1
On	1
his	1
approaching	1
them	1
soon	1
afterwards,	1
though	1
without	1
seeming	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
intention	1
of	1
speaking,	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
defied	1
her	1
friend	1
to	1
mention	1
such	1
a	1
subject	1
to	1
him;	1
which	1
immediately	1
provoking	1
Elizabeth	1
to	1
do	1
it,	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
said:	1
"Did	1
you	1
not	1
think,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
that	1
I	1
expressed	1
myself	1
uncommonly	1
well	1
just	1
now,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
teasing	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
ball	1
at	1
Meryton?"	1
"With	1
great	1
energy;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
a	1
subject	1
which	1
makes	1
a	1
lady	1
energetic."	1
"You	1
are	1
severe	1
on	1
us."	1
"It	1
will	1
be	1
_her_	1
turn	1
soon	1
to	1
be	1
teased,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Lucas.	1
"I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
instrument,	1
Eliza,	1
and	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
follows."	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
very	1
strange	1
creature	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
friend!--always	1
wanting	1
me	1
to	1
play	1
and	1
sing	1
before	1
anybody	1
and	1
everybody!	1
If	1
my	1
vanity	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
musical	1
turn,	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
invaluable;	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
I	1
would	1
really	1
rather	1
not	1
sit	1
down	1
before	1
those	1
who	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
hearing	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
performers."	1
On	1
Miss	1
Lucas's	1
persevering,	1
however,	1
she	1
added,	1
"Very	1
well,	1
if	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so,	1
it	1
must."	1
And	1
gravely	1
glancing	1
at	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
"There	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
old	1
saying,	1
which	1
everybody	1
here	1
is	1
of	1
course	1
familiar	1
with:	1
'Keep	1
your	1
breath	1
to	1
cool	1
your	1
porridge';	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
keep	1
mine	1
to	1
swell	1
my	1
song."	1
Her	1
performance	1
was	1
pleasing,	1
though	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
capital.	1
After	1
a	1
song	1
or	1
two,	1
and	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
entreaties	1
of	1
several	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
sing	1
again,	1
she	1
was	1
eagerly	1
succeeded	1
at	1
the	1
instrument	1
by	1
her	1
sister	1
Mary,	1
who	1
having,	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
only	1
plain	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
family,	1
worked	1
hard	1
for	1
knowledge	1
and	1
accomplishments,	1
was	1
always	1
impatient	1
for	1
display.	1
Mary	1
had	1
neither	1
genius	1
nor	1
taste;	1
and	1
though	1
vanity	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
application,	1
it	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
likewise	1
a	1
pedantic	1
air	1
and	1
conceited	1
manner,	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
injured	1
a	1
higher	1
degree	1
of	1
excellence	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
reached.	1
Elizabeth,	1
easy	1
and	1
unaffected,	1
had	1
been	1
listened	1
to	1
with	1
much	1
more	1
pleasure,	1
though	1
not	1
playing	1
half	1
so	1
well;	1
and	1
Mary,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
concerto,	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
purchase	1
praise	1
and	1
gratitude	1
by	1
Scotch	1
and	1
Irish	1
airs,	1
at	1
the	1
request	1
of	1
her	1
younger	1
sisters,	1
who,	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
Lucases,	1
and	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
officers,	1
joined	1
eagerly	1
in	1
dancing	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
stood	1
near	1
them	1
in	1
silent	1
indignation	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
mode	1
of	1
passing	1
the	1
evening,	1
to	1
the	1
exclusion	1
of	1
all	1
conversation,	1
and	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
engrossed	1
by	1
his	1
thoughts	1
to	1
perceive	1
that	1
Sir	1
William	1
Lucas	1
was	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
till	1
Sir	1
William	1
thus	1
began:	1
"What	1
a	1
charming	1
amusement	1
for	1
young	1
people	1
this	1
is,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy!	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
like	1
dancing	1
after	1
all.	1
I	1
consider	1
it	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
refinements	1
of	1
polished	1
society."	1
"Certainly,	1
sir;	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
the	1
advantage	1
also	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
vogue	1
amongst	1
the	1
less	1
polished	1
societies	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
Every	1
savage	1
can	1
dance."	1
Sir	1
William	1
only	1
smiled.	1
"Your	1
friend	1
performs	1
delightfully,"	1
he	1
continued	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
on	1
seeing	1
Bingley	1
join	1
the	1
group;	1
"and	1
I	1
doubt	1
not	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
an	1
adept	1
in	1
the	1
science	1
yourself,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy."	1
"You	1
saw	1
me	1
dance	1
at	1
Meryton,	1
I	1
believe,	1
sir."	1
"Yes,	1
indeed,	1
and	1
received	1
no	1
inconsiderable	1
pleasure	1
from	1
the	1
sight.	1
Do	1
you	1
often	1
dance	1
at	1
St.	1
James's?"	1
"Never,	1
sir."	1
"Do	1
you	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
proper	1
compliment	1
to	1
the	1
place?"	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
compliment	1
which	1
I	1
never	1
pay	1
to	1
any	1
place	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
avoid	1
it."	1
"You	1
have	1
a	1
house	1
in	1
town,	1
I	1
conclude?"	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
bowed.	1
"I	1
had	1
once	1
had	1
some	1
thought	1
of	1
fixing	1
in	1
town	1
myself--for	1
I	1
am	1
fond	1
of	1
superior	1
society;	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
quite	1
certain	1
that	1
the	1
air	1
of	1
London	1
would	1
agree	1
with	1
Lady	1
Lucas."	1
He	1
paused	1
in	1
hopes	1
of	1
an	1
answer;	1
but	1
his	1
companion	1
was	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
make	1
any;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
moving	1
towards	1
them,	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
with	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
doing	1
a	1
very	1
gallant	1
thing,	1
and	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
her:	1
"My	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Eliza,	1
why	1
are	1
you	1
not	1
dancing?	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
you	1
must	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
present	1
this	1
young	1
lady	1
to	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
desirable	1
partner.	1
You	1
cannot	1
refuse	1
to	1
dance,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
when	1
so	1
much	1
beauty	1
is	1
before	1
you."	1
And,	1
taking	1
her	1
hand,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
who,	1
though	1
extremely	1
surprised,	1
was	1
not	1
unwilling	1
to	1
receive	1
it,	1
when	1
she	1
instantly	1
drew	1
back,	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
some	1
discomposure	1
to	1
Sir	1
William:	1
"Indeed,	1
sir,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
intention	1
of	1
dancing.	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
moved	1
this	1
way	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
beg	1
for	1
a	1
partner."	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
with	1
grave	1
propriety,	1
requested	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
her	1
hand,	1
but	1
in	1
vain.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
determined;	1
nor	1
did	1
Sir	1
William	1
at	1
all	1
shake	1
her	1
purpose	1
by	1
his	1
attempt	1
at	1
persuasion.	1
"You	1
excel	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
dance,	1
Miss	1
Eliza,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
cruel	1
to	1
deny	1
me	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
seeing	1
you;	1
and	1
though	1
this	1
gentleman	1
dislikes	1
the	1
amusement	1
in	1
general,	1
he	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
objection,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
to	1
oblige	1
us	1
for	1
one	1
half-hour."	1
"Mr.	1
Darcy	1
is	1
all	1
politeness,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
smiling.	1
"He	1
is,	1
indeed;	1
but,	1
considering	1
the	1
inducement,	1
my	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Eliza,	1
we	1
cannot	1
wonder	1
at	1
his	1
complaisance--for	1
who	1
would	1
object	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
partner?"	1
Elizabeth	1
looked	1
archly,	1
and	1
turned	1
away.	1
Her	1
resistance	1
had	1
not	1
injured	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
her	1
with	1
some	1
complacency,	1
when	1
thus	1
accosted	1
by	1
Miss	1
Bingley:	1
"I	1
can	1
guess	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
your	1
reverie."	1
"I	1
should	1
imagine	1
not."	1
"You	1
are	1
considering	1
how	1
insupportable	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
pass	1
many	1
evenings	1
in	1
this	1
manner--in	1
such	1
society;	1
and	1
indeed	1
I	1
am	1
quite	1
of	1
your	1
opinion.	1
I	1
was	1
never	1
more	1
annoyed!	1
The	1
insipidity,	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
noise--the	1
nothingness,	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
self-importance	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
people!	1
What	1
would	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
hear	1
your	1
strictures	1
on	1
them!"	1
"Your	1
conjecture	1
is	1
totally	1
wrong,	1
I	1
assure	1
you.	1
My	1
mind	1
was	1
more	1
agreeably	1
engaged.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
meditating	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
great	1
pleasure	1
which	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
fine	1
eyes	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
pretty	1
woman	1
can	1
bestow."	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
immediately	1
fixed	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
desired	1
he	1
would	1
tell	1
her	1
what	1
lady	1
had	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
inspiring	1
such	1
reflections.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
replied	1
with	1
great	1
intrepidity:	1
"Miss	1
Elizabeth	1
Bennet."	1
"Miss	1
Elizabeth	1
Bennet!"	1
repeated	1
Miss	1
Bingley.	1
"I	1
am	1
all	1
astonishment.	1
How	1
long	1
has	1
she	1
been	1
such	1
a	1
favourite?--and	1
pray,	1
when	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
wish	1
you	1
joy?"	1
"That	1
is	1
exactly	1
the	1
question	1
which	1
I	1
expected	1
you	1
to	1
ask.	1
A	1
lady's	1
imagination	1
is	1
very	1
rapid;	1
it	1
jumps	1
from	1
admiration	1
to	1
love,	1
from	1
love	1
to	1
matrimony,	1
in	1
a	1
moment.	1
I	1
knew	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
wishing	1
me	1
joy."	1
"Nay,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
serious	1
about	1
it,	1
I	1
shall	1
consider	1
the	1
matter	1
is	1
absolutely	1
settled.	1
You	1
will	1
be	1
having	1
a	1
charming	1
mother-in-law,	1
indeed;	1
and,	1
of	1
course,	1
she	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
at	1
Pemberley	1
with	1
you."	1
He	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
perfect	1
indifference	1
while	1
she	1
chose	1
to	1
entertain	1
herself	1
in	1
this	1
manner;	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
composure	1
convinced	1
her	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
safe,	1
her	1
wit	1
flowed	1
long.	1
Chapter	1
7	1
Mr.	1
Bennet's	1
property	1
consisted	1
almost	1
entirely	1
in	1
an	1
estate	1
of	1
two	1
thousand	1
a	1
year,	1
which,	1
unfortunately	1
for	1
his	1
daughters,	1
was	1
entailed,	1
in	1
default	1
of	1
heirs	1
male,	1
on	1
a	1
distant	1
relation;	1
and	1
their	1
mother's	1
fortune,	1
though	1
ample	1
for	1
her	1
situation	1
in	1
life,	1
could	1
but	1
ill	1
supply	1
the	1
deficiency	1
of	1
his.	1
Her	1
father	1
had	1
been	1
an	1
attorney	1
in	1
Meryton,	1
and	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
four	1
thousand	1
pounds.	1
She	1
had	1
a	1
sister	1
married	1
to	1
a	1
Mr.	1
Phillips,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
clerk	1
to	1
their	1
father	1
and	1
succeeded	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
business,	1
and	1
a	1
brother	1
settled	1
in	1
London	1
in	1
a	1
respectable	1
line	1
of	1
trade.	1
The	1
village	1
of	1
Longbourn	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
mile	1
from	1
Meryton;	1
a	1
most	1
convenient	1
distance	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
ladies,	1
who	1
were	1
usually	1
tempted	1
thither	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
times	1
a	1
week,	1
to	1
pay	1
their	1
duty	1
to	1
their	1
aunt	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
milliner's	1
shop	1
just	1
over	1
the	1
way.	1
The	1
two	1
youngest	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
Catherine	1
and	1
Lydia,	1
were	1
particularly	1
frequent	1
in	1
these	1
attentions;	1
their	1
minds	1
were	1
more	1
vacant	1
than	1
their	1
sisters',	1
and	1
when	1
nothing	1
better	1
offered,	1
a	1
walk	1
to	1
Meryton	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
amuse	1
their	1
morning	1
hours	1
and	1
furnish	1
conversation	1
for	1
the	1
evening;	1
and	1
however	1
bare	1
of	1
news	1
the	1
country	1
in	1
general	1
might	1
be,	1
they	1
always	1
contrived	1
to	1
learn	1
some	1
from	1
their	1
aunt.	1
At	1
present,	1
indeed,	1
they	1
were	1
well	1
supplied	1
both	1
with	1
news	1
and	1
happiness	1
by	1
the	1
recent	1
arrival	1
of	1
a	1
militia	1
regiment	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood;	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
remain	1
the	1
whole	1
winter,	1
and	1
Meryton	1
was	1
the	1
headquarters.	1
Their	1
visits	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips	1
were	1
now	1
productive	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
interesting	1
intelligence.	1
Every	1
day	1
added	1
something	1
to	1
their	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
officers'	1
names	1
and	1
connections.	1
Their	1
lodgings	1
were	1
not	1
long	1
a	1
secret,	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
officers	1
themselves.	1
Mr.	1
Phillips	1
visited	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
this	1
opened	1
to	1
his	1
nieces	1
a	1
store	1
of	1
felicity	1
unknown	1
before.	1
They	1
could	1
talk	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
officers;	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
large	1
fortune,	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
which	1
gave	1
animation	1
to	1
their	1
mother,	1
was	1
worthless	1
in	1
their	1
eyes	1
when	1
opposed	1
to	1
the	1
regimentals	1
of	1
an	1
ensign.	1
After	1
listening	1
one	1
morning	1
to	1
their	1
effusions	1
on	1
this	1
subject,	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
coolly	1
observed:	1
"From	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
collect	1
by	1
your	1
manner	1
of	1
talking,	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
silliest	1
girls	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
I	1
have	1
suspected	1
it	1
some	1
time,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
convinced."	1
Catherine	1
was	1
disconcerted,	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
answer;	1
but	1
Lydia,	1
with	1
perfect	1
indifference,	1
continued	1
to	1
express	1
her	1
admiration	1
of	1
Captain	1
Carter,	1
and	1
her	1
hope	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
to	1
London.	1
"I	1
am	1
astonished,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
"that	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
ready	1
to	1
think	1
your	1
own	1
children	1
silly.	1
If	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
think	1
slightingly	1
of	1
anybody's	1
children,	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
of	1
my	1
own,	1
however."	1
"If	1
my	1
children	1
are	1
silly,	1
I	1
must	1
hope	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
sensible	1
of	1
it."	1
"Yes--but	1
as	1
it	1
happens,	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
very	1
clever."	1
"This	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
point,	1
I	1
flatter	1
myself,	1
on	1
which	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
agree.	1
I	1
had	1
hoped	1
that	1
our	1
sentiments	1
coincided	1
in	1
every	1
particular,	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
so	1
far	1
differ	1
from	1
you	1
as	1
to	1
think	1
our	1
two	1
youngest	1
daughters	1
uncommonly	1
foolish."	1
"My	1
dear	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
expect	1
such	1
girls	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
their	1
father	1
and	1
mother.	1
When	1
they	1
get	1
to	1
our	1
age,	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
think	1
about	1
officers	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
we	1
do.	1
I	1
remember	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
I	1
liked	1
a	1
red	1
coat	1
myself	1
very	1
well--and,	1
indeed,	1
so	1
I	1
do	1
still	1
at	1
my	1
heart;	1
and	1
if	1
a	1
smart	1
young	1
colonel,	1
with	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
thousand	1
a	1
year,	1
should	1
want	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
girls	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
say	1
nay	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
looked	1
very	1
becoming	1
the	1
other	1
night	1
at	1
Sir	1
William's	1
in	1
his	1
regimentals."	1
"Mamma,"	1
cried	1
Lydia,	1
"my	1
aunt	1
says	1
that	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
and	1
Captain	1
Carter	1
do	1
not	1
go	1
so	1
often	1
to	1
Miss	1
Watson's	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
when	1
they	1
first	1
came;	1
she	1
sees	1
them	1
now	1
very	1
often	1
standing	1
in	1
Clarke's	1
library."	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
prevented	1
replying	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
footman	1
with	1
a	1
note	1
for	1
Miss	1
Bennet;	1
it	1
came	1
from	1
Netherfield,	1
and	1
the	1
servant	1
waited	1
for	1
an	1
answer.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet's	1
eyes	1
sparkled	1
with	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
eagerly	1
calling	1
out,	1
while	1
her	1
daughter	1
read,	1
"Well,	1
Jane,	1
who	1
is	1
it	1
from?	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
about?	1
What	1
does	1
he	1
say?	1
Well,	1
Jane,	1
make	1
haste	1
and	1
tell	1
us;	1
make	1
haste,	1
my	1
love."	1
"It	1
is	1
from	1
Miss	1
Bingley,"	1
said	1
Jane,	1
and	1
then	1
read	1
it	1
aloud.	1
"MY	1
DEAR	1
FRIEND,--	1
"If	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
compassionate	1
as	1
to	1
dine	1
to-day	1
with	1
Louisa	1
and	1
me,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
hating	1
each	1
other	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
our	1
lives,	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
day's	1
tete-a-tete	1
between	1
two	1
women	1
can	1
never	1
end	1
without	1
a	1
quarrel.	1
Come	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
on	1
receipt	1
of	1
this.	1
My	1
brother	1
and	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
are	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
the	1
officers.--Yours	1
ever,	1
"CAROLINE	1
BINGLEY"	1
"With	1
the	1
officers!"	1
cried	1
Lydia.	1
"I	1
wonder	1
my	1
aunt	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
us	1
of	1
_that_."	1
"Dining	1
out,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
"that	1
is	1
very	1
unlucky."	1
"Can	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
carriage?"	1
said	1
Jane.	1
"No,	1
my	1
dear,	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
go	1
on	1
horseback,	1
because	1
it	1
seems	1
likely	1
to	1
rain;	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
must	1
stay	1
all	1
night."	1
"That	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
scheme,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
"if	1
you	1
were	1
sure	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
offer	1
to	1
send	1
her	1
home."	1
"Oh!	1
but	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
will	1
have	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
chaise	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Meryton,	1
and	1
the	1
Hursts	1
have	1
no	1
horses	1
to	1
theirs."	1
"I	1
had	1
much	1
rather	1
go	1
in	1
the	1
coach."	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear,	1
your	1
father	1
cannot	1
spare	1
the	1
horses,	1
I	1
am	1
sure.	1
They	1
are	1
wanted	1
in	1
the	1
farm,	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
are	1
they	1
not?"	1
"They	1
are	1
wanted	1
in	1
the	1
farm	1
much	1
oftener	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
get	1
them."	1
"But	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
them	1
to-day,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
"my	1
mother's	1
purpose	1
will	1
be	1
answered."	1
She	1
did	1
at	1
last	1
extort	1
from	1
her	1
father	1
an	1
acknowledgment	1
that	1
the	1
horses	1
were	1
engaged.	1
Jane	1
was	1
therefore	1
obliged	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
horseback,	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
attended	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
many	1
cheerful	1
prognostics	1
of	1
a	1
bad	1
day.	1
Her	1
hopes	1
were	1
answered;	1
Jane	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
gone	1
long	1
before	1
it	1
rained	1
hard.	1
Her	1
sisters	1
were	1
uneasy	1
for	1
her,	1
but	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
delighted.	1
The	1
rain	1
continued	1
the	1
whole	1
evening	1
without	1
intermission;	1
Jane	1
certainly	1
could	1
not	1
come	1
back.	1
"This	1
was	1
a	1
lucky	1
idea	1
of	1
mine,	1
indeed!"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
more	1
than	1
once,	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
making	1
it	1
rain	1
were	1
all	1
her	1
own.	1
Till	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
however,	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
aware	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
felicity	1
of	1
her	1
contrivance.	1
Breakfast	1
was	1
scarcely	1
over	1
when	1
a	1
servant	1
from	1
Netherfield	1
brought	1
the	1
following	1
note	1
for	1
Elizabeth:	1
"MY	1
DEAREST	1
LIZZY,--	1
"I	1
find	1
myself	1
very	1
unwell	1
this	1
morning,	1
which,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
imputed	1
to	1
my	1
getting	1
wet	1
through	1
yesterday.	1
My	1
kind	1
friends	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
my	1
returning	1
till	1
I	1
am	1
better.	1
They	1
insist	1
also	1
on	1
my	1
seeing	1
Mr.	1
Jones--therefore	1
do	1
not	1
be	1
alarmed	1
if	1
you	1
should	1
hear	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
been	1
to	1
me--and,	1
excepting	1
a	1
sore	1
throat	1
and	1
headache,	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
much	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
me.--Yours,	1
etc."	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
when	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
note	1
aloud,	1
"if	1
your	1
daughter	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
dangerous	1
fit	1
of	1
illness--if	1
she	1
should	1
die,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
comfort	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
and	1
under	1
your	1
orders."	1
"Oh!	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
her	1
dying.	1
People	1
do	1
not	1
die	1
of	1
little	1
trifling	1
colds.	1
She	1
will	1
be	1
taken	1
good	1
care	1
of.	1
As	1
long	1
as	1
she	1
stays	1
there,	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
well.	1
I	1
would	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
the	1
carriage."	1
Elizabeth,	1
feeling	1
really	1
anxious,	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
her,	1
though	1
the	1
carriage	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
had;	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
no	1
horsewoman,	1
walking	1
was	1
her	1
only	1
alternative.	1
She	1
declared	1
her	1
resolution.	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
so	1
silly,"	1
cried	1
her	1
mother,	1
"as	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing,	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
dirt!	1
You	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
fit	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
when	1
you	1
get	1
there."	1
"I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
fit	1
to	1
see	1
Jane--which	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
want."	1
"Is	1
this	1
a	1
hint	1
to	1
me,	1
Lizzy,"	1
said	1
her	1
father,	1
"to	1
send	1
for	1
the	1
horses?"	1
"No,	1
indeed,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
walk.	1
The	1
distance	1
is	1
nothing	1
when	1
one	1
has	1
a	1
motive;	1
only	1
three	1
miles.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
back	1
by	1
dinner."	1
"I	1
admire	1
the	1
activity	1
of	1
your	1
benevolence,"	1
observed	1
Mary,	1
"but	1
every	1
impulse	1
of	1
feeling	1
should	1
be	1
guided	1
by	1
reason;	1
and,	1
in	1
my	1
opinion,	1
exertion	1
should	1
always	1
be	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
required."	1
"We	1
will	1
go	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Meryton	1
with	1
you,"	1
said	1
Catherine	1
and	1
Lydia.	1
Elizabeth	1
accepted	1
their	1
company,	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
young	1
ladies	1
set	1
off	1
together.	1
"If	1
we	1
make	1
haste,"	1
said	1
Lydia,	1
as	1
they	1
walked	1
along,	1
"perhaps	1
we	1
may	1
see	1
something	1
of	1
Captain	1
Carter	1
before	1
he	1
goes."	1
In	1
Meryton	1
they	1
parted;	1
the	1
two	1
youngest	1
repaired	1
to	1
the	1
lodgings	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers'	1
wives,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
continued	1
her	1
walk	1
alone,	1
crossing	1
field	1
after	1
field	1
at	1
a	1
quick	1
pace,	1
jumping	1
over	1
stiles	1
and	1
springing	1
over	1
puddles	1
with	1
impatient	1
activity,	1
and	1
finding	1
herself	1
at	1
last	1
within	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
with	1
weary	1
ankles,	1
dirty	1
stockings,	1
and	1
a	1
face	1
glowing	1
with	1
the	1
warmth	1
of	1
exercise.	1
She	1
was	1
shown	1
into	1
the	1
breakfast-parlour,	1
where	1
all	1
but	1
Jane	1
were	1
assembled,	1
and	1
where	1
her	1
appearance	1
created	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
surprise.	1
That	1
she	1
should	1
have	1
walked	1
three	1
miles	1
so	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
day,	1
in	1
such	1
dirty	1
weather,	1
and	1
by	1
herself,	1
was	1
almost	1
incredible	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bingley;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
they	1
held	1
her	1
in	1
contempt	1
for	1
it.	1
She	1
was	1
received,	1
however,	1
very	1
politely	1
by	1
them;	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
brother's	1
manners	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
better	1
than	1
politeness;	1
there	1
was	1
good	1
humour	1
and	1
kindness.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
said	1
very	1
little,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Hurst	1
nothing	1
at	1
all.	1
The	1
former	1
was	1
divided	1
between	1
admiration	1
of	1
the	1
brilliancy	1
which	1
exercise	1
had	1
given	1
to	1
her	1
complexion,	1
and	1
doubt	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
occasion's	1
justifying	1
her	1
coming	1
so	1
far	1
alone.	1
The	1
latter	1
was	1
thinking	1
only	1
of	1
his	1
breakfast.	1
Her	1
inquiries	1
after	1
her	1
sister	1
were	1
not	1
very	1
favourably	1
answered.	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
had	1
slept	1
ill,	1
and	1
though	1
up,	1
was	1
very	1
feverish,	1
and	1
not	1
well	1
enough	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
room.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
her	1
immediately;	1
and	1
Jane,	1
who	1
had	1
only	1
been	1
withheld	1
by	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
giving	1
alarm	1
or	1
inconvenience	1
from	1
expressing	1
in	1
her	1
note	1
how	1
much	1
she	1
longed	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
visit,	1
was	1
delighted	1
at	1
her	1
entrance.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
equal,	1
however,	1
to	1
much	1
conversation,	1
and	1
when	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
left	1
them	1
together,	1
could	1
attempt	1
little	1
besides	1
expressions	1
of	1
gratitude	1
for	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
kindness	1
she	1
was	1
treated	1
with.	1
Elizabeth	1
silently	1
attended	1
her.	1
When	1
breakfast	1
was	1
over	1
they	1
were	1
joined	1
by	1
the	1
sisters;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
began	1
to	1
like	1
them	1
herself,	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
how	1
much	1
affection	1
and	1
solicitude	1
they	1
showed	1
for	1
Jane.	1
The	1
apothecary	1
came,	1
and	1
having	1
examined	1
his	1
patient,	1
said,	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
supposed,	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
caught	1
a	1
violent	1
cold,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
endeavour	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
it;	1
advised	1
her	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
bed,	1
and	1
promised	1
her	1
some	1
draughts.	1
The	1
advice	1
was	1
followed	1
readily,	1
for	1
the	1
feverish	1
symptoms	1
increased,	1
and	1
her	1
head	1
ached	1
acutely.	1
Elizabeth	1
did	1
not	1
quit	1
her	1
room	1
for	1
a	1
moment;	1
nor	1
were	1
the	1
other	1
ladies	1
often	1
absent;	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
being	1
out,	1
they	1
had,	1
in	1
fact,	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
elsewhere.	1
When	1
the	1
clock	1
struck	1
three,	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
go,	1
and	1
very	1
unwillingly	1
said	1
so.	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
offered	1
her	1
the	1
carriage,	1
and	1
she	1
only	1
wanted	1
a	1
little	1
pressing	1
to	1
accept	1
it,	1
when	1
Jane	1
testified	1
such	1
concern	1
in	1
parting	1
with	1
her,	1
that	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
convert	1
the	1
offer	1
of	1
the	1
chaise	1
to	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
remain	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
for	1
the	1
present.	1
Elizabeth	1
most	1
thankfully	1
consented,	1
and	1
a	1
servant	1
was	1
dispatched	1
to	1
Longbourn	1
to	1
acquaint	1
the	1
family	1
with	1
her	1
stay	1
and	1
bring	1
back	1
a	1
supply	1
of	1
clothes.	1
Chapter	1
8	1
At	1
five	1
o'clock	1
the	1
two	1
ladies	1
retired	1
to	1
dress,	1
and	1
at	1
half-past	1
six	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
summoned	1
to	1
dinner.	1
To	1
the	1
civil	1
inquiries	1
which	1
then	1
poured	1
in,	1
and	1
amongst	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
distinguishing	1
the	1
much	1
superior	1
solicitude	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
a	1
very	1
favourable	1
answer.	1
Jane	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
better.	1
The	1
sisters,	1
on	1
hearing	1
this,	1
repeated	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
times	1
how	1
much	1
they	1
were	1
grieved,	1
how	1
shocking	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
bad	1
cold,	1
and	1
how	1
excessively	1
they	1
disliked	1
being	1
ill	1
themselves;	1
and	1
then	1
thought	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
matter:	1
and	1
their	1
indifference	1
towards	1
Jane	1
when	1
not	1
immediately	1
before	1
them	1
restored	1
Elizabeth	1
to	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
former	1
dislike.	1
Their	1
brother,	1
indeed,	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
whom	1
she	1
could	1
regard	1
with	1
any	1
complacency.	1
His	1
anxiety	1
for	1
Jane	1
was	1
evident,	1
and	1
his	1
attentions	1
to	1
herself	1
most	1
pleasing,	1
and	1
they	1
prevented	1
her	1
feeling	1
herself	1
so	1
much	1
an	1
intruder	1
as	1
she	1
believed	1
she	1
was	1
considered	1
by	1
the	1
others.	1
She	1
had	1
very	1
little	1
notice	1
from	1
any	1
but	1
him.	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
was	1
engrossed	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
her	1
sister	1
scarcely	1
less	1
so;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Hurst,	1
by	1
whom	1
Elizabeth	1
sat,	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
indolent	1
man,	1
who	1
lived	1
only	1
to	1
eat,	1
drink,	1
and	1
play	1
at	1
cards;	1
who,	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
her	1
to	1
prefer	1
a	1
plain	1
dish	1
to	1
a	1
ragout,	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
her.	1
When	1
dinner	1
was	1
over,	1
she	1
returned	1
directly	1
to	1
Jane,	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
began	1
abusing	1
her	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Her	1
manners	1
were	1
pronounced	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
bad	1
indeed,	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
pride	1
and	1
impertinence;	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
conversation,	1
no	1
style,	1
no	1
beauty.	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst	1
thought	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
added:	1
"She	1
has	1
nothing,	1
in	1
short,	1
to	1
recommend	1
her,	1
but	1
being	1
an	1
excellent	1
walker.	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
forget	1
her	1
appearance	1
this	1
morning.	1
She	1
really	1
looked	1
almost	1
wild."	1
"She	1
did,	1
indeed,	1
Louisa.	1
I	1
could	1
hardly	1
keep	1
my	1
countenance.	1
Very	1
nonsensical	1
to	1
come	1
at	1
all!	1
Why	1
must	1
_she_	1
be	1
scampering	1
about	1
the	1
country,	1
because	1
her	1
sister	1
had	1
a	1
cold?	1
Her	1
hair,	1
so	1
untidy,	1
so	1
blowsy!"	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
her	1
petticoat;	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
saw	1
her	1
petticoat,	1
six	1
inches	1
deep	1
in	1
mud,	1
I	1
am	1
absolutely	1
certain;	1
and	1
the	1
gown	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
let	1
down	1
to	1
hide	1
it	1
not	1
doing	1
its	1
office."	1
"Your	1
picture	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
exact,	1
Louisa,"	1
said	1
Bingley;	1
"but	1
this	1
was	1
all	1
lost	1
upon	1
me.	1
I	1
thought	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth	1
Bennet	1
looked	1
remarkably	1
well	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
this	1
morning.	1
Her	1
dirty	1
petticoat	1
quite	1
escaped	1
my	1
notice."	1
"_You_	1
observed	1
it,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bingley;	1
"and	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
_your_	1
sister	1
make	1
such	1
an	1
exhibition."	1
"Certainly	1
not."	1
"To	1
walk	1
three	1
miles,	1
or	1
four	1
miles,	1
or	1
five	1
miles,	1
or	1
whatever	1
it	1
is,	1
above	1
her	1
ankles	1
in	1
dirt,	1
and	1
alone,	1
quite	1
alone!	1
What	1
could	1
she	1
mean	1
by	1
it?	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
show	1
an	1
abominable	1
sort	1
of	1
conceited	1
independence,	1
a	1
most	1
country-town	1
indifference	1
to	1
decorum."	1
"It	1
shows	1
an	1
affection	1
for	1
her	1
sister	1
that	1
is	1
very	1
pleasing,"	1
said	1
Bingley.	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,"	1
observed	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
in	1
a	1
half	1
whisper,	1
"that	1
this	1
adventure	1
has	1
rather	1
affected	1
your	1
admiration	1
of	1
her	1
fine	1
eyes."	1
"Not	1
at	1
all,"	1
he	1
replied;	1
"they	1
were	1
brightened	1
by	1
the	1
exercise."	1
A	1
short	1
pause	1
followed	1
this	1
speech,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst	1
began	1
again:	1
"I	1
have	1
an	1
excessive	1
regard	1
for	1
Miss	1
Jane	1
Bennet,	1
she	1
is	1
really	1
a	1
very	1
sweet	1
girl,	1
and	1
I	1
wish	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
she	1
were	1
well	1
settled.	1
But	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
and	1
such	1
low	1
connections,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
it."	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
their	1
uncle	1
is	1
an	1
attorney	1
in	1
Meryton."	1
"Yes;	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
another,	1
who	1
lives	1
somewhere	1
near	1
Cheapside."	1
"That	1
is	1
capital,"	1
added	1
her	1
sister,	1
and	1
they	1
both	1
laughed	1
heartily.	1
"If	1
they	1
had	1
uncles	1
enough	1
to	1
fill	1
_all_	1
Cheapside,"	1
cried	1
Bingley,	1
"it	1
would	1
not	1
make	1
them	1
one	1
jot	1
less	1
agreeable."	1
"But	1
it	1
must	1
very	1
materially	1
lessen	1
their	1
chance	1
of	1
marrying	1
men	1
of	1
any	1
consideration	1
in	1
the	1
world,"	1
replied	1
Darcy.	1
To	1
this	1
speech	1
Bingley	1
made	1
no	1
answer;	1
but	1
his	1
sisters	1
gave	1
it	1
their	1
hearty	1
assent,	1
and	1
indulged	1
their	1
mirth	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
their	1
dear	1
friend's	1
vulgar	1
relations.	1
With	1
a	1
renewal	1
of	1
tenderness,	1
however,	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
on	1
leaving	1
the	1
dining-parlour,	1
and	1
sat	1
with	1
her	1
till	1
summoned	1
to	1
coffee.	1
She	1
was	1
still	1
very	1
poorly,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
would	1
not	1
quit	1
her	1
at	1
all,	1
till	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
seeing	1
her	1
sleep,	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
rather	1
right	1
than	1
pleasant	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
go	1
downstairs	1
herself.	1
On	1
entering	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
she	1
found	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
at	1
loo,	1
and	1
was	1
immediately	1
invited	1
to	1
join	1
them;	1
but	1
suspecting	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
playing	1
high	1
she	1
declined	1
it,	1
and	1
making	1
her	1
sister	1
the	1
excuse,	1
said	1
she	1
would	1
amuse	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
short	1
time	1
she	1
could	1
stay	1
below,	1
with	1
a	1
book.	1
Mr.	1
Hurst	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
astonishment.	1
"Do	1
you	1
prefer	1
reading	1
to	1
cards?"	1
said	1
he;	1
"that	1
is	1
rather	1
singular."	1
"Miss	1
Eliza	1
Bennet,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bingley,	1
"despises	1
cards.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
reader,	1
and	1
has	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
anything	1
else."	1
"I	1
deserve	1
neither	1
such	1
praise	1
nor	1
such	1
censure,"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth;	1
"I	1
am	1
_not_	1
a	1
great	1
reader,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
pleasure	1
in	1
many	1
things."	1
"In	1
nursing	1
your	1
sister	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
have	1
pleasure,"	1
said	1
Bingley;	1
"and	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
soon	1
increased	1
by	1
seeing	1
her	1
quite	1
well."	1
Elizabeth	1
thanked	1
him	1
from	1
her	1
heart,	1
and	1
then	1
walked	1
towards	1
the	1
table	1
where	1
a	1
few	1
books	1
were	1
lying.	1
He	1
immediately	1
offered	1
to	1
fetch	1
her	1
others--all	1
that	1
his	1
library	1
afforded.	1
"And	1
I	1
wish	1
my	1
collection	1
were	1
larger	1
for	1
your	1
benefit	1
and	1
my	1
own	1
credit;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
idle	1
fellow,	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
many,	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
ever	1
looked	1
into."	1
Elizabeth	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
suit	1
herself	1
perfectly	1
with	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
"I	1
am	1
astonished,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bingley,	1
"that	1
my	1
father	1
should	1
have	1
left	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
collection	1
of	1
books.	1
What	1
a	1
delightful	1
library	1
you	1
have	1
at	1
Pemberley,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy!"	1
"It	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
good,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
"it	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
many	1
generations."	1
"And	1
then	1
you	1
have	1
added	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
it	1
yourself,	1
you	1
are	1
always	1
buying	1
books."	1
"I	1
cannot	1
comprehend	1
the	1
neglect	1
of	1
a	1
family	1
library	1
in	1
such	1
days	1
as	1
these."	1
"Neglect!	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
neglect	1
nothing	1
that	1
can	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
beauties	1
of	1
that	1
noble	1
place.	1
Charles,	1
when	1
you	1
build	1
_your_	1
house,	1
I	1
wish	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
half	1
as	1
delightful	1
as	1
Pemberley."	1
"I	1
wish	1
it	1
may."	1
"But	1
I	1
would	1
really	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
purchase	1
in	1
that	1
neighbourhood,	1
and	1
take	1
Pemberley	1
for	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
model.	1
There	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
finer	1
county	1
in	1
England	1
than	1
Derbyshire."	1
"With	1
all	1
my	1
heart;	1
I	1
will	1
buy	1
Pemberley	1
itself	1
if	1
Darcy	1
will	1
sell	1
it."	1
"I	1
am	1
talking	1
of	1
possibilities,	1
Charles."	1
"Upon	1
my	1
word,	1
Caroline,	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
it	1
more	1
possible	1
to	1
get	1
Pemberley	1
by	1
purchase	1
than	1
by	1
imitation."	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
caught	1
with	1
what	1
passed,	1
as	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
very	1
little	1
attention	1
for	1
her	1
book;	1
and	1
soon	1
laying	1
it	1
wholly	1
aside,	1
she	1
drew	1
near	1
the	1
card-table,	1
and	1
stationed	1
herself	1
between	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
and	1
his	1
eldest	1
sister,	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
game.	1
"Is	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
much	1
grown	1
since	1
the	1
spring?"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bingley;	1
"will	1
she	1
be	1
as	1
tall	1
as	1
I	1
am?"	1
"I	1
think	1
she	1
will.	1
She	1
is	1
now	1
about	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth	1
Bennet's	1
height,	1
or	1
rather	1
taller."	1
"How	1
I	1
long	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
again!	1
I	1
never	1
met	1
with	1
anybody	1
who	1
delighted	1
me	1
so	1
much.	1
Such	1
a	1
countenance,	1
such	1
manners!	1
And	1
so	1
extremely	1
accomplished	1
for	1
her	1
age!	1
Her	1
performance	1
on	1
the	1
pianoforte	1
is	1
exquisite."	1
"It	1
is	1
amazing	1
to	1
me,"	1
said	1
Bingley,	1
"how	1
young	1
ladies	1
can	1
have	1
patience	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
very	1
accomplished	1
as	1
they	1
all	1
are."	1
"All	1
young	1
ladies	1
accomplished!	1
My	1
dear	1
Charles,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
"Yes,	1
all	1
of	1
them,	1
I	1
think.	1
They	1
all	1
paint	1
tables,	1
cover	1
screens,	1
and	1
net	1
purses.	1
I	1
scarcely	1
know	1
anyone	1
who	1
cannot	1
do	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
spoken	1
of	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
without	1
being	1
informed	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
accomplished."	1
"Your	1
list	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
extent	1
of	1
accomplishments,"	1
said	1
Darcy,	1
"has	1
too	1
much	1
truth.	1
The	1
word	1
is	1
applied	1
to	1
many	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
deserves	1
it	1
no	1
otherwise	1
than	1
by	1
netting	1
a	1
purse	1
or	1
covering	1
a	1
screen.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
agreeing	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
estimation	1
of	1
ladies	1
in	1
general.	1
I	1
cannot	1
boast	1
of	1
knowing	1
more	1
than	1
half-a-dozen,	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
range	1
of	1
my	1
acquaintance,	1
that	1
are	1
really	1
accomplished."	1
"Nor	1
I,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bingley.	1
"Then,"	1
observed	1
Elizabeth,	1
"you	1
must	1
comprehend	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
in	1
your	1
idea	1
of	1
an	1
accomplished	1
woman."	1
"Yes,	1
I	1
do	1
comprehend	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
in	1
it."	1
"Oh!	1
certainly,"	1
cried	1
his	1
faithful	1
assistant,	1
"no	1
one	1
can	1
be	1
really	1
esteemed	1
accomplished	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
greatly	1
surpass	1
what	1
is	1
usually	1
met	1
with.	1
A	1
woman	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
thorough	1
knowledge	1
of	1
music,	1
singing,	1
drawing,	1
dancing,	1
and	1
the	1
modern	1
languages,	1
to	1
deserve	1
the	1
word;	1
and	1
besides	1
all	1
this,	1
she	1
must	1
possess	1
a	1
certain	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
air	1
and	1
manner	1
of	1
walking,	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
her	1
voice,	1
her	1
address	1
and	1
expressions,	1
or	1
the	1
word	1
will	1
be	1
but	1
half-deserved."	1
"All	1
this	1
she	1
must	1
possess,"	1
added	1
Darcy,	1
"and	1
to	1
all	1
this	1
she	1
must	1
yet	1
add	1
something	1
more	1
substantial,	1
in	1
the	1
improvement	1
of	1
her	1
mind	1
by	1
extensive	1
reading."	1
"I	1
am	1
no	1
longer	1
surprised	1
at	1
your	1
knowing	1
_only_	1
six	1
accomplished	1
women.	1
I	1
rather	1
wonder	1
now	1
at	1
your	1
knowing	1
_any_."	1
"Are	1
you	1
so	1
severe	1
upon	1
your	1
own	1
sex	1
as	1
to	1
doubt	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
all	1
this?"	1
"I	1
never	1
saw	1
such	1
a	1
woman.	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
such	1
capacity,	1
and	1
taste,	1
and	1
application,	1
and	1
elegance,	1
as	1
you	1
describe	1
united."	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
both	1
cried	1
out	1
against	1
the	1
injustice	1
of	1
her	1
implied	1
doubt,	1
and	1
were	1
both	1
protesting	1
that	1
they	1
knew	1
many	1
women	1
who	1
answered	1
this	1
description,	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Hurst	1
called	1
them	1
to	1
order,	1
with	1
bitter	1
complaints	1
of	1
their	1
inattention	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
forward.	1
As	1
all	1
conversation	1
was	1
thereby	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
Elizabeth	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
left	1
the	1
room.	1
"Elizabeth	1
Bennet,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bingley,	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
closed	1
on	1
her,	1
"is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
young	1
ladies	1
who	1
seek	1
to	1
recommend	1
themselves	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
sex	1
by	1
undervaluing	1
their	1
own;	1
and	1
with	1
many	1
men,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
it	1
succeeds.	1
But,	1
in	1
my	1
opinion,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
paltry	1
device,	1
a	1
very	1
mean	1
art."	1
"Undoubtedly,"	1
replied	1
Darcy,	1
to	1
whom	1
this	1
remark	1
was	1
chiefly	1
addressed,	1
"there	1
is	1
a	1
meanness	1
in	1
_all_	1
the	1
arts	1
which	1
ladies	1
sometimes	1
condescend	1
to	1
employ	1
for	1
captivation.	1
Whatever	1
bears	1
affinity	1
to	1
cunning	1
is	1
despicable."	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
entirely	1
satisfied	1
with	1
this	1
reply	1
as	1
to	1
continue	1
the	1
subject.	1
Elizabeth	1
joined	1
them	1
again	1
only	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
her	1
sister	1
was	1
worse,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
leave	1
her.	1
Bingley	1
urged	1
Mr.	1
Jones	1
being	1
sent	1
for	1
immediately;	1
while	1
his	1
sisters,	1
convinced	1
that	1
no	1
country	1
advice	1
could	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
service,	1
recommended	1
an	1
express	1
to	1
town	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
eminent	1
physicians.	1
This	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
of;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
unwilling	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
their	1
brother's	1
proposal;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
settled	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Jones	1
should	1
be	1
sent	1
for	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
if	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
were	1
not	1
decidedly	1
better.	1
Bingley	1
was	1
quite	1
uncomfortable;	1
his	1
sisters	1
declared	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
miserable.	1
They	1
solaced	1
their	1
wretchedness,	1
however,	1
by	1
duets	1
after	1
supper,	1
while	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
better	1
relief	1
to	1
his	1
feelings	1
than	1
by	1
giving	1
his	1
housekeeper	1
directions	1
that	1
every	1
attention	1
might	1
be	1
paid	1
to	1
the	1
sick	1
lady	1
and	1
her	1
sister.	1
Chapter	1
9	1
Elizabeth	1
passed	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
her	1
sister's	1
room,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
tolerable	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
inquiries	1
which	1
she	1
very	1
early	1
received	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
by	1
a	1
housemaid,	1
and	1
some	1
time	1
afterwards	1
from	1
the	1
two	1
elegant	1
ladies	1
who	1
waited	1
on	1
his	1
sisters.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
this	1
amendment,	1
however,	1
she	1
requested	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
note	1
sent	1
to	1
Longbourn,	1
desiring	1
her	1
mother	1
to	1
visit	1
Jane,	1
and	1
form	1
her	1
own	1
judgement	1
of	1
her	1
situation.	1
The	1
note	1
was	1
immediately	1
dispatched,	1
and	1
its	1
contents	1
as	1
quickly	1
complied	1
with.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
her	1
two	1
youngest	1
girls,	1
reached	1
Netherfield	1
soon	1
after	1
the	1
family	1
breakfast.	1
Had	1
she	1
found	1
Jane	1
in	1
any	1
apparent	1
danger,	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
miserable;	1
but	1
being	1
satisfied	1
on	1
seeing	1
her	1
that	1
her	1
illness	1
was	1
not	1
alarming,	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
wish	1
of	1
her	1
recovering	1
immediately,	1
as	1
her	1
restoration	1
to	1
health	1
would	1
probably	1
remove	1
her	1
from	1
Netherfield.	1
She	1
would	1
not	1
listen,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
her	1
daughter's	1
proposal	1
of	1
being	1
carried	1
home;	1
neither	1
did	1
the	1
apothecary,	1
who	1
arrived	1
about	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
think	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
advisable.	1
After	1
sitting	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
with	1
Jane,	1
on	1
Miss	1
Bingley's	1
appearance	1
and	1
invitation,	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
three	1
daughters	1
all	1
attended	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
breakfast	1
parlour.	1
Bingley	1
met	1
them	1
with	1
hopes	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
had	1
not	1
found	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
worse	1
than	1
she	1
expected.	1
"Indeed	1
I	1
have,	1
sir,"	1
was	1
her	1
answer.	1
"She	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
too	1
ill	1
to	1
be	1
moved.	1
Mr.	1
Jones	1
says	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
moving	1
her.	1
We	1
must	1
trespass	1
a	1
little	1
longer	1
on	1
your	1
kindness."	1
"Removed!"	1
cried	1
Bingley.	1
"It	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
thought	1
of.	1
My	1
sister,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
will	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
her	1
removal."	1
"You	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
Madam,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bingley,	1
with	1
cold	1
civility,	1
"that	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
will	1
receive	1
every	1
possible	1
attention	1
while	1
she	1
remains	1
with	1
us."	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
profuse	1
in	1
her	1
acknowledgments.	1
"I	1
am	1
sure,"	1
she	1
added,	1
"if	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
such	1
good	1
friends	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
would	1
become	1
of	1
her,	1
for	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
ill	1
indeed,	1
and	1
suffers	1
a	1
vast	1
deal,	1
though	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
patience	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
which	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
her,	1
for	1
she	1
has,	1
without	1
exception,	1
the	1
sweetest	1
temper	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
met	1
with.	1
I	1
often	1
tell	1
my	1
other	1
girls	1
they	1
are	1
nothing	1
to	1
_her_.	1
You	1
have	1
a	1
sweet	1
room	1
here,	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
and	1
a	1
charming	1
prospect	1
over	1
the	1
gravel	1
walk.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
that	1
is	1
equal	1
to	1
Netherfield.	1
You	1
will	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
quitting	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
hurry,	1
I	1
hope,	1
though	1
you	1
have	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
lease."	1
"Whatever	1
I	1
do	1
is	1
done	1
in	1
a	1
hurry,"	1
replied	1
he;	1
"and	1
therefore	1
if	1
I	1
should	1
resolve	1
to	1
quit	1
Netherfield,	1
I	1
should	1
probably	1
be	1
off	1
in	1
five	1
minutes.	1
At	1
present,	1
however,	1
I	1
consider	1
myself	1
as	1
quite	1
fixed	1
here."	1
"That	1
is	1
exactly	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
supposed	1
of	1
you,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth.	1
"You	1
begin	1
to	1
comprehend	1
me,	1
do	1
you?"	1
cried	1
he,	1
turning	1
towards	1
her.	1
"Oh!	1
yes--I	1
understand	1
you	1
perfectly."	1
"I	1
wish	1
I	1
might	1
take	1
this	1
for	1
a	1
compliment;	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
easily	1
seen	1
through	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
is	1
pitiful."	1
"That	1
is	1
as	1
it	1
happens.	1
It	1
does	1
not	1
follow	1
that	1
a	1
deep,	1
intricate	1
character	1
is	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
estimable	1
than	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
yours."	1
"Lizzy,"	1
cried	1
her	1
mother,	1
"remember	1
where	1
you	1
are,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
run	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
wild	1
manner	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
suffered	1
to	1
do	1
at	1
home."	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
before,"	1
continued	1
Bingley	1
immediately,	1
"that	1
you	1
were	1
a	1
studier	1
of	1
character.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
an	1
amusing	1
study."	1
"Yes,	1
but	1
intricate	1
characters	1
are	1
the	1
_most_	1
amusing.	1
They	1
have	1
at	1
least	1
that	1
advantage."	1
"The	1
country,"	1
said	1
Darcy,	1
"can	1
in	1
general	1
supply	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
subjects	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
study.	1
In	1
a	1
country	1
neighbourhood	1
you	1
move	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
confined	1
and	1
unvarying	1
society."	1
"But	1
people	1
themselves	1
alter	1
so	1
much,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
new	1
to	1
be	1
observed	1
in	1
them	1
for	1
ever."	1
"Yes,	1
indeed,"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
offended	1
by	1
his	1
manner	1
of	1
mentioning	1
a	1
country	1
neighbourhood.	1
"I	1
assure	1
you	1
there	1
is	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
of	1
_that_	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
in	1
town."	1
Everybody	1
was	1
surprised,	1
and	1
Darcy,	1
after	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
turned	1
silently	1
away.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
who	1
fancied	1
she	1
had	1
gained	1
a	1
complete	1
victory	1
over	1
him,	1
continued	1
her	1
triumph.	1
"I	1
cannot	1
see	1
that	1
London	1
has	1
any	1
great	1
advantage	1
over	1
the	1
country,	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
except	1
the	1
shops	1
and	1
public	1
places.	1
The	1
country	1
is	1
a	1
vast	1
deal	1
pleasanter,	1
is	1
it	1
not,	1
Mr.	1
Bingley?"	1
"When	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
country,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
"I	1
never	1
wish	1
to	1
leave	1
it;	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
town	1
it	1
is	1
pretty	1
much	1
the	1
same.	1
They	1
have	1
each	1
their	1
advantages,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
be	1
equally	1
happy	1
in	1
either."	1
"Aye--that	1
is	1
because	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
right	1
disposition.	1
But	1
that	1
gentleman,"	1
looking	1
at	1
Darcy,	1
"seemed	1
to	1
think	1
the	1
country	1
was	1
nothing	1
at	1
all."	1
"Indeed,	1
Mamma,	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
blushing	1
for	1
her	1
mother.	1
"You	1
quite	1
mistook	1
Mr.	1
Darcy.	1
He	1
only	1
meant	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
people	1
to	1
be	1
met	1
with	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
town,	1
which	1
you	1
must	1
acknowledge	1
to	1
be	1
true."	1
"Certainly,	1
my	1
dear,	1
nobody	1
said	1
there	1
were;	1
but	1
as	1
to	1
not	1
meeting	1
with	1
many	1
people	1
in	1
this	1
neighbourhood,	1
I	1
believe	1
there	1
are	1
few	1
neighbourhoods	1
larger.	1
I	1
know	1
we	1
dine	1
with	1
four-and-twenty	1
families."	1
Nothing	1
but	1
concern	1
for	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
enable	1
Bingley	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
countenance.	1
His	1
sister	1
was	1
less	1
delicate,	1
and	1
directed	1
her	1
eyes	1
towards	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
expressive	1
smile.	1
Elizabeth,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
saying	1
something	1
that	1
might	1
turn	1
her	1
mother's	1
thoughts,	1
now	1
asked	1
her	1
if	1
Charlotte	1
Lucas	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
since	1
_her_	1
coming	1
away.	1
"Yes,	1
she	1
called	1
yesterday	1
with	1
her	1
father.	1
What	1
an	1
agreeable	1
man	1
Sir	1
William	1
is,	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
is	1
not	1
he?	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
fashion!	1
So	1
genteel	1
and	1
easy!	1
He	1
has	1
always	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
everybody.	1
_That_	1
is	1
my	1
idea	1
of	1
good	1
breeding;	1
and	1
those	1
persons	1
who	1
fancy	1
themselves	1
very	1
important,	1
and	1
never	1
open	1
their	1
mouths,	1
quite	1
mistake	1
the	1
matter."	1
"Did	1
Charlotte	1
dine	1
with	1
you?"	1
"No,	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
home.	1
I	1
fancy	1
she	1
was	1
wanted	1
about	1
the	1
mince-pies.	1
For	1
my	1
part,	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
I	1
always	1
keep	1
servants	1
that	1
can	1
do	1
their	1
own	1
work;	1
_my_	1
daughters	1
are	1
brought	1
up	1
very	1
differently.	1
But	1
everybody	1
is	1
to	1
judge	1
for	1
themselves,	1
and	1
the	1
Lucases	1
are	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
sort	1
of	1
girls,	1
I	1
assure	1
you.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
pity	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
handsome!	1
Not	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
Charlotte	1
so	1
_very_	1
plain--but	1
then	1
she	1
is	1
our	1
particular	1
friend."	1
"She	1
seems	1
a	1
very	1
pleasant	1
young	1
woman."	1
"Oh!	1
dear,	1
yes;	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
own	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
plain.	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
herself	1
has	1
often	1
said	1
so,	1
and	1
envied	1
me	1
Jane's	1
beauty.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
boast	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
child,	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
Jane--one	1
does	1
not	1
often	1
see	1
anybody	1
better	1
looking.	1
It	1
is	1
what	1
everybody	1
says.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
trust	1
my	1
own	1
partiality.	1
When	1
she	1
was	1
only	1
fifteen,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
at	1
my	1
brother	1
Gardiner's	1
in	1
town	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
that	1
my	1
sister-in-law	1
was	1
sure	1
he	1
would	1
make	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
before	1
we	1
came	1
away.	1
But,	1
however,	1
he	1
did	1
not.	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
thought	1
her	1
too	1
young.	1
However,	1
he	1
wrote	1
some	1
verses	1
on	1
her,	1
and	1
very	1
pretty	1
they	1
were."	1
"And	1
so	1
ended	1
his	1
affection,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
impatiently.	1
"There	1
has	1
been	1
many	1
a	1
one,	1
I	1
fancy,	1
overcome	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way.	1
I	1
wonder	1
who	1
first	1
discovered	1
the	1
efficacy	1
of	1
poetry	1
in	1
driving	1
away	1
love!"	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
consider	1
poetry	1
as	1
the	1
_food_	1
of	1
love,"	1
said	1
Darcy.	1
"Of	1
a	1
fine,	1
stout,	1
healthy	1
love	1
it	1
may.	1
Everything	1
nourishes	1
what	1
is	1
strong	1
already.	1
But	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
only	1
a	1
slight,	1
thin	1
sort	1
of	1
inclination,	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
one	1
good	1
sonnet	1
will	1
starve	1
it	1
entirely	1
away."	1
Darcy	1
only	1
smiled;	1
and	1
the	1
general	1
pause	1
which	1
ensued	1
made	1
Elizabeth	1
tremble	1
lest	1
her	1
mother	1
should	1
be	1
exposing	1
herself	1
again.	1
She	1
longed	1
to	1
speak,	1
but	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
to	1
say;	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
silence	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
began	1
repeating	1
her	1
thanks	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
for	1
his	1
kindness	1
to	1
Jane,	1
with	1
an	1
apology	1
for	1
troubling	1
him	1
also	1
with	1
Lizzy.	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
was	1
unaffectedly	1
civil	1
in	1
his	1
answer,	1
and	1
forced	1
his	1
younger	1
sister	1
to	1
be	1
civil	1
also,	1
and	1
say	1
what	1
the	1
occasion	1
required.	1
She	1
performed	1
her	1
part	1
indeed	1
without	1
much	1
graciousness,	1
but	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
satisfied,	1
and	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
ordered	1
her	1
carriage.	1
Upon	1
this	1
signal,	1
the	1
youngest	1
of	1
her	1
daughters	1
put	1
herself	1
forward.	1
The	1
two	1
girls	1
had	1
been	1
whispering	1
to	1
each	1
other	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
visit,	1
and	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
it	1
was,	1
that	1
the	1
youngest	1
should	1
tax	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
with	1
having	1
promised	1
on	1
his	1
first	1
coming	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
ball	1
at	1
Netherfield.	1
Lydia	1
was	1
a	1
stout,	1
well-grown	1
girl	1
of	1
fifteen,	1
with	1
a	1
fine	1
complexion	1
and	1
good-humoured	1
countenance;	1
a	1
favourite	1
with	1
her	1
mother,	1
whose	1
affection	1
had	1
brought	1
her	1
into	1
public	1
at	1
an	1
early	1
age.	1
She	1
had	1
high	1
animal	1
spirits,	1
and	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
natural	1
self-consequence,	1
which	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
officers,	1
to	1
whom	1
her	1
uncle's	1
good	1
dinners,	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
easy	1
manners	1
recommended	1
her,	1
had	1
increased	1
into	1
assurance.	1
She	1
was	1
very	1
equal,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
address	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
ball,	1
and	1
abruptly	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
promise;	1
adding,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
shameful	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
keep	1
it.	1
His	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
sudden	1
attack	1
was	1
delightful	1
to	1
their	1
mother's	1
ear:	1
"I	1
am	1
perfectly	1
ready,	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
engagement;	1
and	1
when	1
your	1
sister	1
is	1
recovered,	1
you	1
shall,	1
if	1
you	1
please,	1
name	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
ball.	1
But	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
dancing	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
ill."	1
Lydia	1
declared	1
herself	1
satisfied.	1
"Oh!	1
yes--it	1
would	1
be	1
much	1
better	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
Jane	1
was	1
well,	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
time	1
most	1
likely	1
Captain	1
Carter	1
would	1
be	1
at	1
Meryton	1
again.	1
And	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
_your_	1
ball,"	1
she	1
added,	1
"I	1
shall	1
insist	1
on	1
their	1
giving	1
one	1
also.	1
I	1
shall	1
tell	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
a	1
shame	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
not."	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
and	1
her	1
daughters	1
then	1
departed,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
returned	1
instantly	1
to	1
Jane,	1
leaving	1
her	1
own	1
and	1
her	1
relations'	1
behaviour	1
to	1
the	1
remarks	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
ladies	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Darcy;	1
the	1
latter	1
of	1
whom,	1
however,	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
their	1
censure	1
of	1
_her_,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
Miss	1
Bingley's	1
witticisms	1
on	1
_fine	1
eyes_.	1
Chapter	1
10	1
The	1
day	1
passed	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
had	1
done.	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
had	1
spent	1
some	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
with	1
the	1
invalid,	1
who	1
continued,	1
though	1
slowly,	1
to	1
mend;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
Elizabeth	1
joined	1
their	1
party	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room.	1
The	1
loo-table,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
appear.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
was	1
writing,	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bingley,	1
seated	1
near	1
him,	1
was	1
watching	1
the	1
progress	1
of	1
his	1
letter	1
and	1
repeatedly	1
calling	1
off	1
his	1
attention	1
by	1
messages	1
to	1
his	1
sister.	1
Mr.	1
Hurst	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
were	1
at	1
piquet,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst	1
was	1
observing	1
their	1
game.	1
Elizabeth	1
took	1
up	1
some	1
needlework,	1
and	1
was	1
sufficiently	1
amused	1
in	1
attending	1
to	1
what	1
passed	1
between	1
Darcy	1
and	1
his	1
companion.	1
The	1
perpetual	1
commendations	1
of	1
the	1
lady,	1
either	1
on	1
his	1
handwriting,	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
evenness	1
of	1
his	1
lines,	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
his	1
letter,	1
with	1
the	1
perfect	1
unconcern	1
with	1
which	1
her	1
praises	1
were	1
received,	1
formed	1
a	1
curious	1
dialogue,	1
and	1
was	1
exactly	1
in	1
union	1
with	1
her	1
opinion	1
of	1
each.	1
"How	1
delighted	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
receive	1
such	1
a	1
letter!"	1
He	1
made	1
no	1
answer.	1
"You	1
write	1
uncommonly	1
fast."	1
"You	1
are	1
mistaken.	1
I	1
write	1
rather	1
slowly."	1
"How	1
many	1
letters	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
occasion	1
to	1
write	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
year!	1
Letters	1
of	1
business,	1
too!	1
How	1
odious	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
them!"	1
"It	1
is	1
fortunate,	1
then,	1
that	1
they	1
fall	1
to	1
my	1
lot	1
instead	1
of	1
yours."	1
"Pray	1
tell	1
your	1
sister	1
that	1
I	1
long	1
to	1
see	1
her."	1
"I	1
have	1
already	1
told	1
her	1
so	1
once,	1
by	1
your	1
desire."	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
your	1
pen.	1
Let	1
me	1
mend	1
it	1
for	1
you.	1
I	1
mend	1
pens	1
remarkably	1
well."	1
"Thank	1
you--but	1
I	1
always	1
mend	1
my	1
own."	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
contrive	1
to	1
write	1
so	1
even?"	1
He	1
was	1
silent.	1
"Tell	1
your	1
sister	1
I	1
am	1
delighted	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
her	1
improvement	1
on	1
the	1
harp;	1
and	1
pray	1
let	1
her	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
quite	1
in	1
raptures	1
with	1
her	1
beautiful	1
little	1
design	1
for	1
a	1
table,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
infinitely	1
superior	1
to	1
Miss	1
Grantley's."	1
"Will	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
defer	1
your	1
raptures	1
till	1
I	1
write	1
again?	1
At	1
present	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
room	1
to	1
do	1
them	1
justice."	1
"Oh!	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
consequence.	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
her	1
in	1
January.	1
But	1
do	1
you	1
always	1
write	1
such	1
charming	1
long	1
letters	1
to	1
her,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy?"	1
"They	1
are	1
generally	1
long;	1
but	1
whether	1
always	1
charming	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
determine."	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
rule	1
with	1
me,	1
that	1
a	1
person	1
who	1
can	1
write	1
a	1
long	1
letter	1
with	1
ease,	1
cannot	1
write	1
ill."	1
"That	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
for	1
a	1
compliment	1
to	1
Darcy,	1
Caroline,"	1
cried	1
her	1
brother,	1
"because	1
he	1
does	1
_not_	1
write	1
with	1
ease.	1
He	1
studies	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
words	1
of	1
four	1
syllables.	1
Do	1
not	1
you,	1
Darcy?"	1
"My	1
style	1
of	1
writing	1
is	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
yours."	1
"Oh!"	1
cried	1
Miss	1
Bingley,	1
"Charles	1
writes	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
careless	1
way	1
imaginable.	1
He	1
leaves	1
out	1
half	1
his	1
words,	1
and	1
blots	1
the	1
rest."	1
"My	1
ideas	1
flow	1
so	1
rapidly	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
time	1
to	1
express	1
them--by	1
which	1
means	1
my	1
letters	1
sometimes	1
convey	1
no	1
ideas	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
my	1
correspondents."	1
"Your	1
humility,	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
"must	1
disarm	1
reproof."	1
"Nothing	1
is	1
more	1
deceitful,"	1
said	1
Darcy,	1
"than	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
humility.	1
It	1
is	1
often	1
only	1
carelessness	1
of	1
opinion,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
an	1
indirect	1
boast."	1
"And	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
do	1
you	1
call	1
_my_	1
little	1
recent	1
piece	1
of	1
modesty?"	1
"The	1
indirect	1
boast;	1
for	1
you	1
are	1
really	1
proud	1
of	1
your	1
defects	1
in	1
writing,	1
because	1
you	1
consider	1
them	1
as	1
proceeding	1
from	1
a	1
rapidity	1
of	1
thought	1
and	1
carelessness	1
of	1
execution,	1
which,	1
if	1
not	1
estimable,	1
you	1
think	1
at	1
least	1
highly	1
interesting.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
doing	1
anything	1
with	1
quickness	1
is	1
always	1
prized	1
much	1
by	1
the	1
possessor,	1
and	1
often	1
without	1
any	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
imperfection	1
of	1
the	1
performance.	1
When	1
you	1
told	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
this	1
morning	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
ever	1
resolved	1
upon	1
quitting	1
Netherfield	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
gone	1
in	1
five	1
minutes,	1
you	1
meant	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
panegyric,	1
of	1
compliment	1
to	1
yourself--and	1
yet	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
so	1
very	1
laudable	1
in	1
a	1
precipitance	1
which	1
must	1
leave	1
very	1
necessary	1
business	1
undone,	1
and	1
can	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
real	1
advantage	1
to	1
yourself	1
or	1
anyone	1
else?"	1
"Nay,"	1
cried	1
Bingley,	1
"this	1
is	1
too	1
much,	1
to	1
remember	1
at	1
night	1
all	1
the	1
foolish	1
things	1
that	1
were	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
And	1
yet,	1
upon	1
my	1
honour,	1
I	1
believe	1
what	1
I	1
said	1
of	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
true,	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
at	1
this	1
moment.	1
At	1
least,	1
therefore,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
assume	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
needless	1
precipitance	1
merely	1
to	1
show	1
off	1
before	1
the	1
ladies."	1
"I	1
dare	1
say	1
you	1
believed	1
it;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
convinced	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
gone	1
with	1
such	1
celerity.	1
Your	1
conduct	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
as	1
dependent	1
on	1
chance	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
any	1
man	1
I	1
know;	1
and	1
if,	1
as	1
you	1
were	1
mounting	1
your	1
horse,	1
a	1
friend	1
were	1
to	1
say,	1
'Bingley,	1
you	1
had	1
better	1
stay	1
till	1
next	1
week,'	1
you	1
would	1
probably	1
do	1
it,	1
you	1
would	1
probably	1
not	1
go--and	1
at	1
another	1
word,	1
might	1
stay	1
a	1
month."	1
"You	1
have	1
only	1
proved	1
by	1
this,"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth,	1
"that	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
justice	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
disposition.	1
You	1
have	1
shown	1
him	1
off	1
now	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
did	1
himself."	1
"I	1
am	1
exceedingly	1
gratified,"	1
said	1
Bingley,	1
"by	1
your	1
converting	1
what	1
my	1
friend	1
says	1
into	1
a	1
compliment	1
on	1
the	1
sweetness	1
of	1
my	1
temper.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
are	1
giving	1
it	1
a	1
turn	1
which	1
that	1
gentleman	1
did	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
intend;	1
for	1
he	1
would	1
certainly	1
think	1
better	1
of	1
me,	1
if	1
under	1
such	1
a	1
circumstance	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
flat	1
denial,	1
and	1
ride	1
off	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
I	1
could."	1
"Would	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
then	1
consider	1
the	1
rashness	1
of	1
your	1
original	1
intentions	1
as	1
atoned	1
for	1
by	1
your	1
obstinacy	1
in	1
adhering	1
to	1
it?"	1
"Upon	1
my	1
word,	1
I	1
cannot	1
exactly	1
explain	1
the	1
matter;	1
Darcy	1
must	1
speak	1
for	1
himself."	1
"You	1
expect	1
me	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
opinions	1
which	1
you	1
choose	1
to	1
call	1
mine,	1
but	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
acknowledged.	1
Allowing	1
the	1
case,	1
however,	1
to	1
stand	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
representation,	1
you	1
must	1
remember,	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
that	1
the	1
friend	1
who	1
is	1
supposed	1
to	1
desire	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
delay	1
of	1
his	1
plan,	1
has	1
merely	1
desired	1
it,	1
asked	1
it	1
without	1
offering	1
one	1
argument	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
its	1
propriety."	1
"To	1
yield	1
readily--easily--to	1
the	1
_persuasion_	1
of	1
a	1
friend	1
is	1
no	1
merit	1
with	1
you."	1
"To	1
yield	1
without	1
conviction	1
is	1
no	1
compliment	1
to	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
either."	1
"You	1
appear	1
to	1
me,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
to	1
allow	1
nothing	1
for	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
friendship	1
and	1
affection.	1
A	1
regard	1
for	1
the	1
requester	1
would	1
often	1
make	1
one	1
readily	1
yield	1
to	1
a	1
request,	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
arguments	1
to	1
reason	1
one	1
into	1
it.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
particularly	1
speaking	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
case	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
supposed	1
about	1
Mr.	1
Bingley.	1
We	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
wait,	1
perhaps,	1
till	1
the	1
circumstance	1
occurs	1
before	1
we	1
discuss	1
the	1
discretion	1
of	1
his	1
behaviour	1
thereupon.	1
But	1
in	1
general	1
and	1
ordinary	1
cases	1
between	1
friend	1
and	1
friend,	1
where	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
is	1
desired	1
by	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
change	1
a	1
resolution	1
of	1
no	1
very	1
great	1
moment,	1
should	1
you	1
think	1
ill	1
of	1
that	1
person	1
for	1
complying	1
with	1
the	1
desire,	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
argued	1
into	1
it?"	1
"Will	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
advisable,	1
before	1
we	1
proceed	1
on	1
this	1
subject,	1
to	1
arrange	1
with	1
rather	1
more	1
precision	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
importance	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
appertain	1
to	1
this	1
request,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
intimacy	1
subsisting	1
between	1
the	1
parties?"	1
"By	1
all	1
means,"	1
cried	1
Bingley;	1
"let	1
us	1
hear	1
all	1
the	1
particulars,	1
not	1
forgetting	1
their	1
comparative	1
height	1
and	1
size;	1
for	1
that	1
will	1
have	1
more	1
weight	1
in	1
the	1
argument,	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
than	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
aware	1
of.	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
that	1
if	1
Darcy	1
were	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
great	1
tall	1
fellow,	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
myself,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
pay	1
him	1
half	1
so	1
much	1
deference.	1
I	1
declare	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
a	1
more	1
awful	1
object	1
than	1
Darcy,	1
on	1
particular	1
occasions,	1
and	1
in	1
particular	1
places;	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
especially,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
Sunday	1
evening,	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
do."	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
smiled;	1
but	1
Elizabeth	1
thought	1
she	1
could	1
perceive	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
rather	1
offended,	1
and	1
therefore	1
checked	1
her	1
laugh.	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
warmly	1
resented	1
the	1
indignity	1
he	1
had	1
received,	1
in	1
an	1
expostulation	1
with	1
her	1
brother	1
for	1
talking	1
such	1
nonsense.	1
"I	1
see	1
your	1
design,	1
Bingley,"	1
said	1
his	1
friend.	1
"You	1
dislike	1
an	1
argument,	1
and	1
want	1
to	1
silence	1
this."	1
"Perhaps	1
I	1
do.	1
Arguments	1
are	1
too	1
much	1
like	1
disputes.	1
If	1
you	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
will	1
defer	1
yours	1
till	1
I	1
am	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
very	1
thankful;	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
may	1
say	1
whatever	1
you	1
like	1
of	1
me."	1
"What	1
you	1
ask,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
"is	1
no	1
sacrifice	1
on	1
my	1
side;	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
had	1
much	1
better	1
finish	1
his	1
letter."	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
took	1
her	1
advice,	1
and	1
did	1
finish	1
his	1
letter.	1
When	1
that	1
business	1
was	1
over,	1
he	1
applied	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
for	1
an	1
indulgence	1
of	1
some	1
music.	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
moved	1
with	1
some	1
alacrity	1
to	1
the	1
pianoforte;	1
and,	1
after	1
a	1
polite	1
request	1
that	1
Elizabeth	1
would	1
lead	1
the	1
way	1
which	1
the	1
other	1
as	1
politely	1
and	1
more	1
earnestly	1
negatived,	1
she	1
seated	1
herself.	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst	1
sang	1
with	1
her	1
sister,	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
thus	1
employed,	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
observing,	1
as	1
she	1
turned	1
over	1
some	1
music-books	1
that	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
instrument,	1
how	1
frequently	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
her.	1
She	1
hardly	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
be	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
admiration	1
to	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
man;	1
and	1
yet	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
because	1
he	1
disliked	1
her,	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
strange.	1
She	1
could	1
only	1
imagine,	1
however,	1
at	1
last	1
that	1
she	1
drew	1
his	1
notice	1
because	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
more	1
wrong	1
and	1
reprehensible,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
ideas	1
of	1
right,	1
than	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
person	1
present.	1
The	1
supposition	1
did	1
not	1
pain	1
her.	1
She	1
liked	1
him	1
too	1
little	1
to	1
care	1
for	1
his	1
approbation.	1
After	1
playing	1
some	1
Italian	1
songs,	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
varied	1
the	1
charm	1
by	1
a	1
lively	1
Scotch	1
air;	1
and	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
drawing	1
near	1
Elizabeth,	1
said	1
to	1
her:	1
"Do	1
not	1
you	1
feel	1
a	1
great	1
inclination,	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
to	1
seize	1
such	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
dancing	1
a	1
reel?"	1
She	1
smiled,	1
but	1
made	1
no	1
answer.	1
He	1
repeated	1
the	1
question,	1
with	1
some	1
surprise	1
at	1
her	1
silence.	1
"Oh!"	1
said	1
she,	1
"I	1
heard	1
you	1
before,	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
immediately	1
determine	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
reply.	1
You	1
wanted	1
me,	1
I	1
know,	1
to	1
say	1
'Yes,'	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
despising	1
my	1
taste;	1
but	1
I	1
always	1
delight	1
in	1
overthrowing	1
those	1
kind	1
of	1
schemes,	1
and	1
cheating	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
their	1
premeditated	1
contempt.	1
I	1
have,	1
therefore,	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
to	1
tell	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
dance	1
a	1
reel	1
at	1
all--and	1
now	1
despise	1
me	1
if	1
you	1
dare."	1
"Indeed	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
dare."	1
Elizabeth,	1
having	1
rather	1
expected	1
to	1
affront	1
him,	1
was	1
amazed	1
at	1
his	1
gallantry;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
sweetness	1
and	1
archness	1
in	1
her	1
manner	1
which	1
made	1
it	1
difficult	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
affront	1
anybody;	1
and	1
Darcy	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
so	1
bewitched	1
by	1
any	1
woman	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
her.	1
He	1
really	1
believed,	1
that	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
inferiority	1
of	1
her	1
connections,	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
some	1
danger.	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
saw,	1
or	1
suspected	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
jealous;	1
and	1
her	1
great	1
anxiety	1
for	1
the	1
recovery	1
of	1
her	1
dear	1
friend	1
Jane	1
received	1
some	1
assistance	1
from	1
her	1
desire	1
of	1
getting	1
rid	1
of	1
Elizabeth.	1
She	1
often	1
tried	1
to	1
provoke	1
Darcy	1
into	1
disliking	1
her	1
guest,	1
by	1
talking	1
of	1
their	1
supposed	1
marriage,	1
and	1
planning	1
his	1
happiness	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
alliance.	1
"I	1
hope,"	1
said	1
she,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
walking	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
shrubbery	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
"you	1
will	1
give	1
your	1
mother-in-law	1
a	1
few	1
hints,	1
when	1
this	1
desirable	1
event	1
takes	1
place,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
holding	1
her	1
tongue;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
can	1
compass	1
it,	1
do	1
cure	1
the	1
younger	1
girls	1
of	1
running	1
after	1
officers.	1
And,	1
if	1
I	1
may	1
mention	1
so	1
delicate	1
a	1
subject,	1
endeavour	1
to	1
check	1
that	1
little	1
something,	1
bordering	1
on	1
conceit	1
and	1
impertinence,	1
which	1
your	1
lady	1
possesses."	1
"Have	1
you	1
anything	1
else	1
to	1
propose	1
for	1
my	1
domestic	1
felicity?"	1
"Oh!	1
yes.	1
Do	1
let	1
the	1
portraits	1
of	1
your	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
Phillips	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
gallery	1
at	1
Pemberley.	1
Put	1
them	1
next	1
to	1
your	1
great-uncle	1
the	1
judge.	1
They	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
profession,	1
you	1
know,	1
only	1
in	1
different	1
lines.	1
As	1
for	1
your	1
Elizabeth's	1
picture,	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
have	1
it	1
taken,	1
for	1
what	1
painter	1
could	1
do	1
justice	1
to	1
those	1
beautiful	1
eyes?"	1
"It	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
easy,	1
indeed,	1
to	1
catch	1
their	1
expression,	1
but	1
their	1
colour	1
and	1
shape,	1
and	1
the	1
eyelashes,	1
so	1
remarkably	1
fine,	1
might	1
be	1
copied."	1
At	1
that	1
moment	1
they	1
were	1
met	1
from	1
another	1
walk	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
herself.	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
intended	1
to	1
walk,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bingley,	1
in	1
some	1
confusion,	1
lest	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
overheard.	1
"You	1
used	1
us	1
abominably	1
ill,"	1
answered	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst,	1
"running	1
away	1
without	1
telling	1
us	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
coming	1
out."	1
Then	1
taking	1
the	1
disengaged	1
arm	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
she	1
left	1
Elizabeth	1
to	1
walk	1
by	1
herself.	1
The	1
path	1
just	1
admitted	1
three.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
felt	1
their	1
rudeness,	1
and	1
immediately	1
said:	1
"This	1
walk	1
is	1
not	1
wide	1
enough	1
for	1
our	1
party.	1
We	1
had	1
better	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
avenue."	1
But	1
Elizabeth,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
inclination	1
to	1
remain	1
with	1
them,	1
laughingly	1
answered:	1
"No,	1
no;	1
stay	1
where	1
you	1
are.	1
You	1
are	1
charmingly	1
grouped,	1
and	1
appear	1
to	1
uncommon	1
advantage.	1
The	1
picturesque	1
would	1
be	1
spoilt	1
by	1
admitting	1
a	1
fourth.	1
Good-bye."	1
She	1
then	1
ran	1
gaily	1
off,	1
rejoicing	1
as	1
she	1
rambled	1
about,	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
being	1
at	1
home	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two.	1
Jane	1
was	1
already	1
so	1
much	1
recovered	1
as	1
to	1
intend	1
leaving	1
her	1
room	1
for	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
hours	1
that	1
evening.	1
Chapter	1
11	1
When	1
the	1
ladies	1
removed	1
after	1
dinner,	1
Elizabeth	1
ran	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
sister,	1
and	1
seeing	1
her	1
well	1
guarded	1
from	1
cold,	1
attended	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
welcomed	1
by	1
her	1
two	1
friends	1
with	1
many	1
professions	1
of	1
pleasure;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
them	1
so	1
agreeable	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
during	1
the	1
hour	1
which	1
passed	1
before	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
appeared.	1
Their	1
powers	1
of	1
conversation	1
were	1
considerable.	1
They	1
could	1
describe	1
an	1
entertainment	1
with	1
accuracy,	1
relate	1
an	1
anecdote	1
with	1
humour,	1
and	1
laugh	1
at	1
their	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
spirit.	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
entered,	1
Jane	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
the	1
first	1
object;	1
Miss	1
Bingley's	1
eyes	1
were	1
instantly	1
turned	1
toward	1
Darcy,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
advanced	1
many	1
steps.	1
He	1
addressed	1
himself	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
with	1
a	1
polite	1
congratulation;	1
Mr.	1
Hurst	1
also	1
made	1
her	1
a	1
slight	1
bow,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
"very	1
glad;"	1
but	1
diffuseness	1
and	1
warmth	1
remained	1
for	1
Bingley's	1
salutation.	1
He	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
joy	1
and	1
attention.	1
The	1
first	1
half-hour	1
was	1
spent	1
in	1
piling	1
up	1
the	1
fire,	1
lest	1
she	1
should	1
suffer	1
from	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
room;	1
and	1
she	1
removed	1
at	1
his	1
desire	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fireplace,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
further	1
from	1
the	1
door.	1
He	1
then	1
sat	1
down	1
by	1
her,	1
and	1
talked	1
scarcely	1
to	1
anyone	1
else.	1
Elizabeth,	1
at	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
opposite	1
corner,	1
saw	1
it	1
all	1
with	1
great	1
delight.	1
When	1
tea	1
was	1
over,	1
Mr.	1
Hurst	1
reminded	1
his	1
sister-in-law	1
of	1
the	1
card-table--but	1
in	1
vain.	1
She	1
had	1
obtained	1
private	1
intelligence	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
for	1
cards;	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Hurst	1
soon	1
found	1
even	1
his	1
open	1
petition	1
rejected.	1
She	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
intended	1
to	1
play,	1
and	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
seemed	1
to	1
justify	1
her.	1
Mr.	1
Hurst	1
had	1
therefore	1
nothing	1
to	1
do,	1
but	1
to	1
stretch	1
himself	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sofas	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
sleep.	1
Darcy	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
book;	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
did	1
the	1
same;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst,	1
principally	1
occupied	1
in	1
playing	1
with	1
her	1
bracelets	1
and	1
rings,	1
joined	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
her	1
brother's	1
conversation	1
with	1
Miss	1
Bennet.	1
Miss	1
Bingley's	1
attention	1
was	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
engaged	1
in	1
watching	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
progress	1
through	1
_his_	1
book,	1
as	1
in	1
reading	1
her	1
own;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
perpetually	1
either	1
making	1
some	1
inquiry,	1
or	1
looking	1
at	1
his	1
page.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
win	1
him,	1
however,	1
to	1
any	1
conversation;	1
he	1
merely	1
answered	1
her	1
question,	1
and	1
read	1
on.	1
At	1
length,	1
quite	1
exhausted	1
by	1
the	1
attempt	1
to	1
be	1
amused	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
book,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
only	1
chosen	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
second	1
volume	1
of	1
his,	1
she	1
gave	1
a	1
great	1
yawn	1
and	1
said,	1
"How	1
pleasant	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
spend	1
an	1
evening	1
in	1
this	1
way!	1
I	1
declare	1
after	1
all	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
enjoyment	1
like	1
reading!	1
How	1
much	1
sooner	1
one	1
tires	1
of	1
anything	1
than	1
of	1
a	1
book!	1
When	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
own,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
miserable	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
an	1
excellent	1
library."	1
No	1
one	1
made	1
any	1
reply.	1
She	1
then	1
yawned	1
again,	1
threw	1
aside	1
her	1
book,	1
and	1
cast	1
her	1
eyes	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
quest	1
for	1
some	1
amusement;	1
when	1
hearing	1
her	1
brother	1
mentioning	1
a	1
ball	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
she	1
turned	1
suddenly	1
towards	1
him	1
and	1
said:	1
"By	1
the	1
bye,	1
Charles,	1
are	1
you	1
really	1
serious	1
in	1
meditating	1
a	1
dance	1
at	1
Netherfield?	1
I	1
would	1
advise	1
you,	1
before	1
you	1
determine	1
on	1
it,	1
to	1
consult	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
party;	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
mistaken	1
if	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
some	1
among	1
us	1
to	1
whom	1
a	1
ball	1
would	1
be	1
rather	1
a	1
punishment	1
than	1
a	1
pleasure."	1
"If	1
you	1
mean	1
Darcy,"	1
cried	1
her	1
brother,	1
"he	1
may	1
go	1
to	1
bed,	1
if	1
he	1
chooses,	1
before	1
it	1
begins--but	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
ball,	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
settled	1
thing;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Nicholls	1
has	1
made	1
white	1
soup	1
enough,	1
I	1
shall	1
send	1
round	1
my	1
cards."	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
balls	1
infinitely	1
better,"	1
she	1
replied,	1
"if	1
they	1
were	1
carried	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
different	1
manner;	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
insufferably	1
tedious	1
in	1
the	1
usual	1
process	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
meeting.	1
It	1
would	1
surely	1
be	1
much	1
more	1
rational	1
if	1
conversation	1
instead	1
of	1
dancing	1
were	1
made	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
day."	1
"Much	1
more	1
rational,	1
my	1
dear	1
Caroline,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
near	1
so	1
much	1
like	1
a	1
ball."	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
made	1
no	1
answer,	1
and	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
room.	1
Her	1
figure	1
was	1
elegant,	1
and	1
she	1
walked	1
well;	1
but	1
Darcy,	1
at	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
aimed,	1
was	1
still	1
inflexibly	1
studious.	1
In	1
the	1
desperation	1
of	1
her	1
feelings,	1
she	1
resolved	1
on	1
one	1
effort	1
more,	1
and,	1
turning	1
to	1
Elizabeth,	1
said:	1
"Miss	1
Eliza	1
Bennet,	1
let	1
me	1
persuade	1
you	1
to	1
follow	1
my	1
example,	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
turn	1
about	1
the	1
room.	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
refreshing	1
after	1
sitting	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
one	1
attitude."	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
surprised,	1
but	1
agreed	1
to	1
it	1
immediately.	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
succeeded	1
no	1
less	1
in	1
the	1
real	1
object	1
of	1
her	1
civility;	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
looked	1
up.	1
He	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
awake	1
to	1
the	1
novelty	1
of	1
attention	1
in	1
that	1
quarter	1
as	1
Elizabeth	1
herself	1
could	1
be,	1
and	1
unconsciously	1
closed	1
his	1
book.	1
He	1
was	1
directly	1
invited	1
to	1
join	1
their	1
party,	1
but	1
he	1
declined	1
it,	1
observing	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
imagine	1
but	1
two	1
motives	1
for	1
their	1
choosing	1
to	1
walk	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
together,	1
with	1
either	1
of	1
which	1
motives	1
his	1
joining	1
them	1
would	1
interfere.	1
"What	1
could	1
he	1
mean?	1
She	1
was	1
dying	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
his	1
meaning?"--and	1
asked	1
Elizabeth	1
whether	1
she	1
could	1
at	1
all	1
understand	1
him?	1
"Not	1
at	1
all,"	1
was	1
her	1
answer;	1
"but	1
depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
he	1
means	1
to	1
be	1
severe	1
on	1
us,	1
and	1
our	1
surest	1
way	1
of	1
disappointing	1
him	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
ask	1
nothing	1
about	1
it."	1
Miss	1
Bingley,	1
however,	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
disappointing	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
in	1
anything,	1
and	1
persevered	1
therefore	1
in	1
requiring	1
an	1
explanation	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
motives.	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
objection	1
to	1
explaining	1
them,"	1
said	1
he,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
allowed	1
him	1
to	1
speak.	1
"You	1
either	1
choose	1
this	1
method	1
of	1
passing	1
the	1
evening	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
each	1
other's	1
confidence,	1
and	1
have	1
secret	1
affairs	1
to	1
discuss,	1
or	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
conscious	1
that	1
your	1
figures	1
appear	1
to	1
the	1
greatest	1
advantage	1
in	1
walking;	1
if	1
the	1
first,	1
I	1
would	1
be	1
completely	1
in	1
your	1
way,	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
second,	1
I	1
can	1
admire	1
you	1
much	1
better	1
as	1
I	1
sit	1
by	1
the	1
fire."	1
"Oh!	1
shocking!"	1
cried	1
Miss	1
Bingley.	1
"I	1
never	1
heard	1
anything	1
so	1
abominable.	1
How	1
shall	1
we	1
punish	1
him	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
speech?"	1
"Nothing	1
so	1
easy,	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
but	1
the	1
inclination,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth.	1
"We	1
can	1
all	1
plague	1
and	1
punish	1
one	1
another.	1
Tease	1
him--laugh	1
at	1
him.	1
Intimate	1
as	1
you	1
are,	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done."	1
"But	1
upon	1
my	1
honour,	1
I	1
do	1
_not_.	1
I	1
do	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
my	1
intimacy	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
taught	1
me	1
_that_.	1
Tease	1
calmness	1
of	1
manner	1
and	1
presence	1
of	1
mind!	1
No,	1
no;	1
I	1
feel	1
he	1
may	1
defy	1
us	1
there.	1
And	1
as	1
to	1
laughter,	1
we	1
will	1
not	1
expose	1
ourselves,	1
if	1
you	1
please,	1
by	1
attempting	1
to	1
laugh	1
without	1
a	1
subject.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
may	1
hug	1
himself."	1
"Mr.	1
Darcy	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
laughed	1
at!"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth.	1
"That	1
is	1
an	1
uncommon	1
advantage,	1
and	1
uncommon	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
will	1
continue,	1
for	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
loss	1
to	1
_me_	1
to	1
have	1
many	1
such	1
acquaintances.	1
I	1
dearly	1
love	1
a	1
laugh."	1
"Miss	1
Bingley,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"has	1
given	1
me	1
more	1
credit	1
than	1
can	1
be.	1
The	1
wisest	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
men--nay,	1
the	1
wisest	1
and	1
best	1
of	1
their	1
actions--may	1
be	1
rendered	1
ridiculous	1
by	1
a	1
person	1
whose	1
first	1
object	1
in	1
life	1
is	1
a	1
joke."	1
"Certainly,"	1
replied	1
Elizabeth--"there	1
are	1
such	1
people,	1
but	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
_them_.	1
I	1
hope	1
I	1
never	1
ridicule	1
what	1
is	1
wise	1
and	1
good.	1
Follies	1
and	1
nonsense,	1
whims	1
and	1
inconsistencies,	1
_do_	1
divert	1
me,	1
I	1
own,	1
and	1
I	1
laugh	1
at	1
them	1
whenever	1
I	1
can.	1
But	1
these,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
are	1
precisely	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
without."	1
"Perhaps	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
possible	1
for	1
anyone.	1
But	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
to	1
avoid	1
those	1
weaknesses	1
which	1
often	1
expose	1
a	1
strong	1
understanding	1
to	1
ridicule."	1
"Such	1
as	1
vanity	1
and	1
pride."	1
"Yes,	1
vanity	1
is	1
a	1
weakness	1
indeed.	1
But	1
pride--where	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
real	1
superiority	1
of	1
mind,	1
pride	1
will	1
be	1
always	1
under	1
good	1
regulation."	1
Elizabeth	1
turned	1
away	1
to	1
hide	1
a	1
smile.	1
"Your	1
examination	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
is	1
over,	1
I	1
presume,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bingley;	1
"and	1
pray	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
result?"	1
"I	1
am	1
perfectly	1
convinced	1
by	1
it	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
has	1
no	1
defect.	1
He	1
owns	1
it	1
himself	1
without	1
disguise."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Darcy,	1
"I	1
have	1
made	1
no	1
such	1
pretension.	1
I	1
have	1
faults	1
enough,	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
not,	1
I	1
hope,	1
of	1
understanding.	1
My	1
temper	1
I	1
dare	1
not	1
vouch	1
for.	1
It	1
is,	1
I	1
believe,	1
too	1
little	1
yielding--certainly	1
too	1
little	1
for	1
the	1
convenience	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
I	1
cannot	1
forget	1
the	1
follies	1
and	1
vices	1
of	1
others	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
ought,	1
nor	1
their	1
offenses	1
against	1
myself.	1
My	1
feelings	1
are	1
not	1
puffed	1
about	1
with	1
every	1
attempt	1
to	1
move	1
them.	1
My	1
temper	1
would	1
perhaps	1
be	1
called	1
resentful.	1
My	1
good	1
opinion	1
once	1
lost,	1
is	1
lost	1
forever."	1
"_That_	1
is	1
a	1
failing	1
indeed!"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth.	1
"Implacable	1
resentment	1
_is_	1
a	1
shade	1
in	1
a	1
character.	1
But	1
you	1
have	1
chosen	1
your	1
fault	1
well.	1
I	1
really	1
cannot	1
_laugh_	1
at	1
it.	1
You	1
are	1
safe	1
from	1
me."	1
"There	1
is,	1
I	1
believe,	1
in	1
every	1
disposition	1
a	1
tendency	1
to	1
some	1
particular	1
evil--a	1
natural	1
defect,	1
which	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
best	1
education	1
can	1
overcome."	1
"And	1
_your_	1
defect	1
is	1
to	1
hate	1
everybody."	1
"And	1
yours,"	1
he	1
replied	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
"is	1
willfully	1
to	1
misunderstand	1
them."	1
"Do	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
music,"	1
cried	1
Miss	1
Bingley,	1
tired	1
of	1
a	1
conversation	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
share.	1
"Louisa,	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
mind	1
my	1
waking	1
Mr.	1
Hurst?"	1
Her	1
sister	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
objection,	1
and	1
the	1
pianoforte	1
was	1
opened;	1
and	1
Darcy,	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
moments'	1
recollection,	1
was	1
not	1
sorry	1
for	1
it.	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
paying	1
Elizabeth	1
too	1
much	1
attention.	1
Chapter	1
12	1
In	1
consequence	1
of	1
an	1
agreement	1
between	1
the	1
sisters,	1
Elizabeth	1
wrote	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
to	1
their	1
mother,	1
to	1
beg	1
that	1
the	1
carriage	1
might	1
be	1
sent	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
But	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
who	1
had	1
calculated	1
on	1
her	1
daughters	1
remaining	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
till	1
the	1
following	1
Tuesday,	1
which	1
would	1
exactly	1
finish	1
Jane's	1
week,	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
herself	1
to	1
receive	1
them	1
with	1
pleasure	1
before.	1
Her	1
answer,	1
therefore,	1
was	1
not	1
propitious,	1
at	1
least	1
not	1
to	1
Elizabeth's	1
wishes,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
impatient	1
to	1
get	1
home.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
sent	1
them	1
word	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
have	1
the	1
carriage	1
before	1
Tuesday;	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
postscript	1
it	1
was	1
added,	1
that	1
if	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
and	1
his	1
sister	1
pressed	1
them	1
to	1
stay	1
longer,	1
she	1
could	1
spare	1
them	1
very	1
well.	1
Against	1
staying	1
longer,	1
however,	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
positively	1
resolved--nor	1
did	1
she	1
much	1
expect	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
asked;	1
and	1
fearful,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
as	1
being	1
considered	1
as	1
intruding	1
themselves	1
needlessly	1
long,	1
she	1
urged	1
Jane	1
to	1
borrow	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
carriage	1
immediately,	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
it	1
was	1
settled	1
that	1
their	1
original	1
design	1
of	1
leaving	1
Netherfield	1
that	1
morning	1
should	1
be	1
mentioned,	1
and	1
the	1
request	1
made.	1
The	1
communication	1
excited	1
many	1
professions	1
of	1
concern;	1
and	1
enough	1
was	1
said	1
of	1
wishing	1
them	1
to	1
stay	1
at	1
least	1
till	1
the	1
following	1
day	1
to	1
work	1
on	1
Jane;	1
and	1
till	1
the	1
morrow	1
their	1
going	1
was	1
deferred.	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
was	1
then	1
sorry	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
proposed	1
the	1
delay,	1
for	1
her	1
jealousy	1
and	1
dislike	1
of	1
one	1
sister	1
much	1
exceeded	1
her	1
affection	1
for	1
the	1
other.	1
The	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
heard	1
with	1
real	1
sorrow	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
so	1
soon,	1
and	1
repeatedly	1
tried	1
to	1
persuade	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
safe	1
for	1
her--that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
enough	1
recovered;	1
but	1
Jane	1
was	1
firm	1
where	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
right.	1
To	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
it	1
was	1
welcome	1
intelligence--Elizabeth	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
long	1
enough.	1
She	1
attracted	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
liked--and	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
was	1
uncivil	1
to	1
_her_,	1
and	1
more	1
teasing	1
than	1
usual	1
to	1
himself.	1
He	1
wisely	1
resolved	1
to	1
be	1
particularly	1
careful	1
that	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
admiration	1
should	1
_now_	1
escape	1
him,	1
nothing	1
that	1
could	1
elevate	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
influencing	1
his	1
felicity;	1
sensible	1
that	1
if	1
such	1
an	1
idea	1
had	1
been	1
suggested,	1
his	1
behaviour	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
must	1
have	1
material	1
weight	1
in	1
confirming	1
or	1
crushing	1
it.	1
Steady	1
to	1
his	1
purpose,	1
he	1
scarcely	1
spoke	1
ten	1
words	1
to	1
her	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
Saturday,	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
left	1
by	1
themselves	1
for	1
half-an-hour,	1
he	1
adhered	1
most	1
conscientiously	1
to	1
his	1
book,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
even	1
look	1
at	1
her.	1
On	1
Sunday,	1
after	1
morning	1
service,	1
the	1
separation,	1
so	1
agreeable	1
to	1
almost	1
all,	1
took	1
place.	1
Miss	1
Bingley's	1
civility	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
increased	1
at	1
last	1
very	1
rapidly,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
her	1
affection	1
for	1
Jane;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
parted,	1
after	1
assuring	1
the	1
latter	1
of	1
the	1
pleasure	1
it	1
would	1
always	1
give	1
her	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
either	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
or	1
Netherfield,	1
and	1
embracing	1
her	1
most	1
tenderly,	1
she	1
even	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
the	1
former.	1
Elizabeth	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
in	1
the	1
liveliest	1
of	1
spirits.	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
welcomed	1
home	1
very	1
cordially	1
by	1
their	1
mother.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
wondered	1
at	1
their	1
coming,	1
and	1
thought	1
them	1
very	1
wrong	1
to	1
give	1
so	1
much	1
trouble,	1
and	1
was	1
sure	1
Jane	1
would	1
have	1
caught	1
cold	1
again.	1
But	1
their	1
father,	1
though	1
very	1
laconic	1
in	1
his	1
expressions	1
of	1
pleasure,	1
was	1
really	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
them;	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
their	1
importance	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
circle.	1
The	1
evening	1
conversation,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
assembled,	1
had	1
lost	1
much	1
of	1
its	1
animation,	1
and	1
almost	1
all	1
its	1
sense	1
by	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
Jane	1
and	1
Elizabeth.	1
They	1
found	1
Mary,	1
as	1
usual,	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
thorough-bass	1
and	1
human	1
nature;	1
and	1
had	1
some	1
extracts	1
to	1
admire,	1
and	1
some	1
new	1
observations	1
of	1
threadbare	1
morality	1
to	1
listen	1
to.	1
Catherine	1
and	1
Lydia	1
had	1
information	1
for	1
them	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
sort.	1
Much	1
had	1
been	1
done	1
and	1
much	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
regiment	1
since	1
the	1
preceding	1
Wednesday;	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
had	1
dined	1
lately	1
with	1
their	1
uncle,	1
a	1
private	1
had	1
been	1
flogged,	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
actually	1
been	1
hinted	1
that	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
married.	1
Chapter	1
13	1
"I	1
hope,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
to	1
his	1
wife,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
breakfast	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
"that	1
you	1
have	1
ordered	1
a	1
good	1
dinner	1
to-day,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
expect	1
an	1
addition	1
to	1
our	1
family	1
party."	1
"Who	1
do	1
you	1
mean,	1
my	1
dear?	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
nobody	1
that	1
is	1
coming,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
unless	1
Charlotte	1
Lucas	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
call	1
in--and	1
I	1
hope	1
_my_	1
dinners	1
are	1
good	1
enough	1
for	1
her.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
she	1
often	1
sees	1
such	1
at	1
home."	1
"The	1
person	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
speak	1
is	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
a	1
stranger."	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet's	1
eyes	1
sparkled.	1
"A	1
gentleman	1
and	1
a	1
stranger!	1
It	1
is	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
I	1
am	1
sure!	1
Well,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
extremely	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
Mr.	1
Bingley.	1
But--good	1
Lord!	1
how	1
unlucky!	1
There	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
fish	1
to	1
be	1
got	1
to-day.	1
Lydia,	1
my	1
love,	1
ring	1
the	1
bell--I	1
must	1
speak	1
to	1
Hill	1
this	1
moment."	1
"It	1
is	1
_not_	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,"	1
said	1
her	1
husband;	1
"it	1
is	1
a	1
person	1
whom	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
my	1
life."	1
This	1
roused	1
a	1
general	1
astonishment;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
being	1
eagerly	1
questioned	1
by	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
his	1
five	1
daughters	1
at	1
once.	1
After	1
amusing	1
himself	1
some	1
time	1
with	1
their	1
curiosity,	1
he	1
thus	1
explained:	1
"About	1
a	1
month	1
ago	1
I	1
received	1
this	1
letter;	1
and	1
about	1
a	1
fortnight	1
ago	1
I	1
answered	1
it,	1
for	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
some	1
delicacy,	1
and	1
requiring	1
early	1
attention.	1
It	1
is	1
from	1
my	1
cousin,	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
who,	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
dead,	1
may	1
turn	1
you	1
all	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
pleases."	1
"Oh!	1
my	1
dear,"	1
cried	1
his	1
wife,	1
"I	1
cannot	1
bear	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
mentioned.	1
Pray	1
do	1
not	1
talk	1
of	1
that	1
odious	1
man.	1
I	1
do	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
hardest	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
your	1
estate	1
should	1
be	1
entailed	1
away	1
from	1
your	1
own	1
children;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
you,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
tried	1
long	1
ago	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
or	1
other	1
about	1
it."	1
Jane	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
tried	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
an	1
entail.	1
They	1
had	1
often	1
attempted	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
before,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
subject	1
on	1
which	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
beyond	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
reason,	1
and	1
she	1
continued	1
to	1
rail	1
bitterly	1
against	1
the	1
cruelty	1
of	1
settling	1
an	1
estate	1
away	1
from	1
a	1
family	1
of	1
five	1
daughters,	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
whom	1
nobody	1
cared	1
anything	1
about.	1
"It	1
certainly	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
iniquitous	1
affair,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
"and	1
nothing	1
can	1
clear	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
from	1
the	1
guilt	1
of	1
inheriting	1
Longbourn.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
listen	1
to	1
his	1
letter,	1
you	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
softened	1
by	1
his	1
manner	1
of	1
expressing	1
himself."	1
"No,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
shall	1
not;	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
impertinent	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
you	1
at	1
all,	1
and	1
very	1
hypocritical.	1
I	1
hate	1
such	1
false	1
friends.	1
Why	1
could	1
he	1
not	1
keep	1
on	1
quarreling	1
with	1
you,	1
as	1
his	1
father	1
did	1
before	1
him?"	1
"Why,	1
indeed;	1
he	1
does	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
some	1
filial	1
scruples	1
on	1
that	1
head,	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
hear."	1
"Hunsford,	1
near	1
Westerham,	1
Kent,	1
15th	1
October.	1
"Dear	1
Sir,--	1
"The	1
disagreement	1
subsisting	1
between	1
yourself	1
and	1
my	1
late	1
honoured	1
father	1
always	1
gave	1
me	1
much	1
uneasiness,	1
and	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
misfortune	1
to	1
lose	1
him,	1
I	1
have	1
frequently	1
wished	1
to	1
heal	1
the	1
breach;	1
but	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
I	1
was	1
kept	1
back	1
by	1
my	1
own	1
doubts,	1
fearing	1
lest	1
it	1
might	1
seem	1
disrespectful	1
to	1
his	1
memory	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
good	1
terms	1
with	1
anyone	1
with	1
whom	1
it	1
had	1
always	1
pleased	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
variance.--'There,	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet.'--My	1
mind,	1
however,	1
is	1
now	1
made	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
for	1
having	1
received	1
ordination	1
at	1
Easter,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
fortunate	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
distinguished	1
by	1
the	1
patronage	1
of	1
the	1
Right	1
Honourable	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh,	1
widow	1
of	1
Sir	1
Lewis	1
de	1
Bourgh,	1
whose	1
bounty	1
and	1
beneficence	1
has	1
preferred	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
valuable	1
rectory	1
of	1
this	1
parish,	1
where	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
earnest	1
endeavour	1
to	1
demean	1
myself	1
with	1
grateful	1
respect	1
towards	1
her	1
ladyship,	1
and	1
be	1
ever	1
ready	1
to	1
perform	1
those	1
rites	1
and	1
ceremonies	1
which	1
are	1
instituted	1
by	1
the	1
Church	1
of	1
England.	1
As	1
a	1
clergyman,	1
moreover,	1
I	1
feel	1
it	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
promote	1
and	1
establish	1
the	1
blessing	1
of	1
peace	1
in	1
all	1
families	1
within	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
my	1
influence;	1
and	1
on	1
these	1
grounds	1
I	1
flatter	1
myself	1
that	1
my	1
present	1
overtures	1
are	1
highly	1
commendable,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
circumstance	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
next	1
in	1
the	1
entail	1
of	1
Longbourn	1
estate	1
will	1
be	1
kindly	1
overlooked	1
on	1
your	1
side,	1
and	1
not	1
lead	1
you	1
to	1
reject	1
the	1
offered	1
olive-branch.	1
I	1
cannot	1
be	1
otherwise	1
than	1
concerned	1
at	1
being	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
injuring	1
your	1
amiable	1
daughters,	1
and	1
beg	1
leave	1
to	1
apologise	1
for	1
it,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
assure	1
you	1
of	1
my	1
readiness	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
every	1
possible	1
amends--but	1
of	1
this	1
hereafter.	1
If	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
receive	1
me	1
into	1
your	1
house,	1
I	1
propose	1
myself	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
waiting	1
on	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
family,	1
Monday,	1
November	1
18th,	1
by	1
four	1
o'clock,	1
and	1
shall	1
probably	1
trespass	1
on	1
your	1
hospitality	1
till	1
the	1
Saturday	1
se'ennight	1
following,	1
which	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
without	1
any	1
inconvenience,	1
as	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
objecting	1
to	1
my	1
occasional	1
absence	1
on	1
a	1
Sunday,	1
provided	1
that	1
some	1
other	1
clergyman	1
is	1
engaged	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
the	1
day.--I	1
remain,	1
dear	1
sir,	1
with	1
respectful	1
compliments	1
to	1
your	1
lady	1
and	1
daughters,	1
your	1
well-wisher	1
and	1
friend,	1
"WILLIAM	1
COLLINS"	1
"At	1
four	1
o'clock,	1
therefore,	1
we	1
may	1
expect	1
this	1
peace-making	1
gentleman,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
as	1
he	1
folded	1
up	1
the	1
letter.	1
"He	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
most	1
conscientious	1
and	1
polite	1
young	1
man,	1
upon	1
my	1
word,	1
and	1
I	1
doubt	1
not	1
will	1
prove	1
a	1
valuable	1
acquaintance,	1
especially	1
if	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
indulgent	1
as	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
again."	1
"There	1
is	1
some	1
sense	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
says	1
about	1
the	1
girls,	1
however,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
disposed	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
any	1
amends,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
person	1
to	1
discourage	1
him."	1
"Though	1
it	1
is	1
difficult,"	1
said	1
Jane,	1
"to	1
guess	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
he	1
can	1
mean	1
to	1
make	1
us	1
the	1
atonement	1
he	1
thinks	1
our	1
due,	1
the	1
wish	1
is	1
certainly	1
to	1
his	1
credit."	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
chiefly	1
struck	1
by	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
deference	1
for	1
Lady	1
Catherine,	1
and	1
his	1
kind	1
intention	1
of	1
christening,	1
marrying,	1
and	1
burying	1
his	1
parishioners	1
whenever	1
it	1
were	1
required.	1
"He	1
must	1
be	1
an	1
oddity,	1
I	1
think,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"I	1
cannot	1
make	1
him	1
out.--There	1
is	1
something	1
very	1
pompous	1
in	1
his	1
style.--And	1
what	1
can	1
he	1
mean	1
by	1
apologising	1
for	1
being	1
next	1
in	1
the	1
entail?--We	1
cannot	1
suppose	1
he	1
would	1
help	1
it	1
if	1
he	1
could.--Could	1
he	1
be	1
a	1
sensible	1
man,	1
sir?"	1
"No,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
think	1
not.	1
I	1
have	1
great	1
hopes	1
of	1
finding	1
him	1
quite	1
the	1
reverse.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
servility	1
and	1
self-importance	1
in	1
his	1
letter,	1
which	1
promises	1
well.	1
I	1
am	1
impatient	1
to	1
see	1
him."	1
"In	1
point	1
of	1
composition,"	1
said	1
Mary,	1
"the	1
letter	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
defective.	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
olive-branch	1
perhaps	1
is	1
not	1
wholly	1
new,	1
yet	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
expressed."	1
To	1
Catherine	1
and	1
Lydia,	1
neither	1
the	1
letter	1
nor	1
its	1
writer	1
were	1
in	1
any	1
degree	1
interesting.	1
It	1
was	1
next	1
to	1
impossible	1
that	1
their	1
cousin	1
should	1
come	1
in	1
a	1
scarlet	1
coat,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
some	1
weeks	1
since	1
they	1
had	1
received	1
pleasure	1
from	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
colour.	1
As	1
for	1
their	1
mother,	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
letter	1
had	1
done	1
away	1
much	1
of	1
her	1
ill-will,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
preparing	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
composure	1
which	1
astonished	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
daughters.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
was	1
punctual	1
to	1
his	1
time,	1
and	1
was	1
received	1
with	1
great	1
politeness	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
family.	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
indeed	1
said	1
little;	1
but	1
the	1
ladies	1
were	1
ready	1
enough	1
to	1
talk,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
seemed	1
neither	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
encouragement,	1
nor	1
inclined	1
to	1
be	1
silent	1
himself.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
tall,	1
heavy-looking	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
five-and-twenty.	1
His	1
air	1
was	1
grave	1
and	1
stately,	1
and	1
his	1
manners	1
were	1
very	1
formal.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
long	1
seated	1
before	1
he	1
complimented	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
on	1
having	1
so	1
fine	1
a	1
family	1
of	1
daughters;	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
much	1
of	1
their	1
beauty,	1
but	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
instance	1
fame	1
had	1
fallen	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
truth;	1
and	1
added,	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
doubt	1
her	1
seeing	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
due	1
time	1
disposed	1
of	1
in	1
marriage.	1
This	1
gallantry	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
hearers;	1
but	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
who	1
quarreled	1
with	1
no	1
compliments,	1
answered	1
most	1
readily.	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
kind,	1
I	1
am	1
sure;	1
and	1
I	1
wish	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
it	1
may	1
prove	1
so,	1
for	1
else	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
destitute	1
enough.	1
Things	1
are	1
settled	1
so	1
oddly."	1
"You	1
allude,	1
perhaps,	1
to	1
the	1
entail	1
of	1
this	1
estate."	1
"Ah!	1
sir,	1
I	1
do	1
indeed.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
grievous	1
affair	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
girls,	1
you	1
must	1
confess.	1
Not	1
that	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
find	1
fault	1
with	1
_you_,	1
for	1
such	1
things	1
I	1
know	1
are	1
all	1
chance	1
in	1
this	1
world.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
knowing	1
how	1
estates	1
will	1
go	1
when	1
once	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
entailed."	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
sensible,	1
madam,	1
of	1
the	1
hardship	1
to	1
my	1
fair	1
cousins,	1
and	1
could	1
say	1
much	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
cautious	1
of	1
appearing	1
forward	1
and	1
precipitate.	1
But	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
that	1
I	1
come	1
prepared	1
to	1
admire	1
them.	1
At	1
present	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
say	1
more;	1
but,	1
perhaps,	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
better	1
acquainted--"	1
He	1
was	1
interrupted	1
by	1
a	1
summons	1
to	1
dinner;	1
and	1
the	1
girls	1
smiled	1
on	1
each	1
other.	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
objects	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
admiration.	1
The	1
hall,	1
the	1
dining-room,	1
and	1
all	1
its	1
furniture,	1
were	1
examined	1
and	1
praised;	1
and	1
his	1
commendation	1
of	1
everything	1
would	1
have	1
touched	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet's	1
heart,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
mortifying	1
supposition	1
of	1
his	1
viewing	1
it	1
all	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
future	1
property.	1
The	1
dinner	1
too	1
in	1
its	1
turn	1
was	1
highly	1
admired;	1
and	1
he	1
begged	1
to	1
know	1
to	1
which	1
of	1
his	1
fair	1
cousins	1
the	1
excellency	1
of	1
its	1
cooking	1
was	1
owing.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
set	1
right	1
there	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
who	1
assured	1
him	1
with	1
some	1
asperity	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
well	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
good	1
cook,	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
daughters	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
kitchen.	1
He	1
begged	1
pardon	1
for	1
having	1
displeased	1
her.	1
In	1
a	1
softened	1
tone	1
she	1
declared	1
herself	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
offended;	1
but	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
apologise	1
for	1
about	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour.	1
Chapter	1
14	1
During	1
dinner,	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
scarcely	1
spoke	1
at	1
all;	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
servants	1
were	1
withdrawn,	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
time	1
to	1
have	1
some	1
conversation	1
with	1
his	1
guest,	1
and	1
therefore	1
started	1
a	1
subject	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
expected	1
him	1
to	1
shine,	1
by	1
observing	1
that	1
he	1
seemed	1
very	1
fortunate	1
in	1
his	1
patroness.	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh's	1
attention	1
to	1
his	1
wishes,	1
and	1
consideration	1
for	1
his	1
comfort,	1
appeared	1
very	1
remarkable.	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
chosen	1
better.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
was	1
eloquent	1
in	1
her	1
praise.	1
The	1
subject	1
elevated	1
him	1
to	1
more	1
than	1
usual	1
solemnity	1
of	1
manner,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
most	1
important	1
aspect	1
he	1
protested	1
that	1
"he	1
had	1
never	1
in	1
his	1
life	1
witnessed	1
such	1
behaviour	1
in	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
rank--such	1
affability	1
and	1
condescension,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
experienced	1
from	1
Lady	1
Catherine.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
graciously	1
pleased	1
to	1
approve	1
of	1
both	1
of	1
the	1
discourses	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
had	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
preaching	1
before	1
her.	1
She	1
had	1
also	1
asked	1
him	1
twice	1
to	1
dine	1
at	1
Rosings,	1
and	1
had	1
sent	1
for	1
him	1
only	1
the	1
Saturday	1
before,	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
her	1
pool	1
of	1
quadrille	1
in	1
the	1
evening.	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
was	1
reckoned	1
proud	1
by	1
many	1
people	1
he	1
knew,	1
but	1
_he_	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
anything	1
but	1
affability	1
in	1
her.	1
She	1
had	1
always	1
spoken	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
gentleman;	1
she	1
made	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
objection	1
to	1
his	1
joining	1
in	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
nor	1
to	1
his	1
leaving	1
the	1
parish	1
occasionally	1
for	1
a	1
week	1
or	1
two,	1
to	1
visit	1
his	1
relations.	1
She	1
had	1
even	1
condescended	1
to	1
advise	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
provided	1
he	1
chose	1
with	1
discretion;	1
and	1
had	1
once	1
paid	1
him	1
a	1
visit	1
in	1
his	1
humble	1
parsonage,	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
perfectly	1
approved	1
all	1
the	1
alterations	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
making,	1
and	1
had	1
even	1
vouchsafed	1
to	1
suggest	1
some	1
herself--some	1
shelves	1
in	1
the	1
closet	1
up	1
stairs."	1
"That	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
proper	1
and	1
civil,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
"and	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
agreeable	1
woman.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
pity	1
that	1
great	1
ladies	1
in	1
general	1
are	1
not	1
more	1
like	1
her.	1
Does	1
she	1
live	1
near	1
you,	1
sir?"	1
"The	1
garden	1
in	1
which	1
stands	1
my	1
humble	1
abode	1
is	1
separated	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
lane	1
from	1
Rosings	1
Park,	1
her	1
ladyship's	1
residence."	1
"I	1
think	1
you	1
said	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
widow,	1
sir?	1
Has	1
she	1
any	1
family?"	1
"She	1
has	1
only	1
one	1
daughter,	1
the	1
heiress	1
of	1
Rosings,	1
and	1
of	1
very	1
extensive	1
property."	1
"Ah!"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
shaking	1
her	1
head,	1
"then	1
she	1
is	1
better	1
off	1
than	1
many	1
girls.	1
And	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
young	1
lady	1
is	1
she?	1
Is	1
she	1
handsome?"	1
"She	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
charming	1
young	1
lady	1
indeed.	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
herself	1
says	1
that,	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
true	1
beauty,	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
is	1
far	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
handsomest	1
of	1
her	1
sex,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
that	1
in	1
her	1
features	1
which	1
marks	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
of	1
distinguished	1
birth.	1
She	1
is	1
unfortunately	1
of	1
a	1
sickly	1
constitution,	1
which	1
has	1
prevented	1
her	1
from	1
making	1
that	1
progress	1
in	1
many	1
accomplishments	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
otherwise	1
failed	1
of,	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
informed	1
by	1
the	1
lady	1
who	1
superintended	1
her	1
education,	1
and	1
who	1
still	1
resides	1
with	1
them.	1
But	1
she	1
is	1
perfectly	1
amiable,	1
and	1
often	1
condescends	1
to	1
drive	1
by	1
my	1
humble	1
abode	1
in	1
her	1
little	1
phaeton	1
and	1
ponies."	1
"Has	1
she	1
been	1
presented?	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
remember	1
her	1
name	1
among	1
the	1
ladies	1
at	1
court."	1
"Her	1
indifferent	1
state	1
of	1
health	1
unhappily	1
prevents	1
her	1
being	1
in	1
town;	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
means,	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
one	1
day,	1
has	1
deprived	1
the	1
British	1
court	1
of	1
its	1
brightest	1
ornament.	1
Her	1
ladyship	1
seemed	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
idea;	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
imagine	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
happy	1
on	1
every	1
occasion	1
to	1
offer	1
those	1
little	1
delicate	1
compliments	1
which	1
are	1
always	1
acceptable	1
to	1
ladies.	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
observed	1
to	1
Lady	1
Catherine,	1
that	1
her	1
charming	1
daughter	1
seemed	1
born	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
duchess,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
elevated	1
rank,	1
instead	1
of	1
giving	1
her	1
consequence,	1
would	1
be	1
adorned	1
by	1
her.	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
little	1
things	1
which	1
please	1
her	1
ladyship,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
attention	1
which	1
I	1
conceive	1
myself	1
peculiarly	1
bound	1
to	1
pay."	1
"You	1
judge	1
very	1
properly,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
"and	1
it	1
is	1
happy	1
for	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
possess	1
the	1
talent	1
of	1
flattering	1
with	1
delicacy.	1
May	1
I	1
ask	1
whether	1
these	1
pleasing	1
attentions	1
proceed	1
from	1
the	1
impulse	1
of	1
the	1
moment,	1
or	1
are	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
previous	1
study?"	1
"They	1
arise	1
chiefly	1
from	1
what	1
is	1
passing	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
sometimes	1
amuse	1
myself	1
with	1
suggesting	1
and	1
arranging	1
such	1
little	1
elegant	1
compliments	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
adapted	1
to	1
ordinary	1
occasions,	1
I	1
always	1
wish	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
as	1
unstudied	1
an	1
air	1
as	1
possible."	1
Mr.	1
Bennet's	1
expectations	1
were	1
fully	1
answered.	1
His	1
cousin	1
was	1
as	1
absurd	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
hoped,	1
and	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
keenest	1
enjoyment,	1
maintaining	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
the	1
most	1
resolute	1
composure	1
of	1
countenance,	1
and,	1
except	1
in	1
an	1
occasional	1
glance	1
at	1
Elizabeth,	1
requiring	1
no	1
partner	1
in	1
his	1
pleasure.	1
By	1
tea-time,	1
however,	1
the	1
dose	1
had	1
been	1
enough,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
glad	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
guest	1
into	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
again,	1
and,	1
when	1
tea	1
was	1
over,	1
glad	1
to	1
invite	1
him	1
to	1
read	1
aloud	1
to	1
the	1
ladies.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
readily	1
assented,	1
and	1
a	1
book	1
was	1
produced;	1
but,	1
on	1
beholding	1
it	1
(for	1
everything	1
announced	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
from	1
a	1
circulating	1
library),	1
he	1
started	1
back,	1
and	1
begging	1
pardon,	1
protested	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
read	1
novels.	1
Kitty	1
stared	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
Lydia	1
exclaimed.	1
Other	1
books	1
were	1
produced,	1
and	1
after	1
some	1
deliberation	1
he	1
chose	1
Fordyce's	1
Sermons.	1
Lydia	1
gaped	1
as	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
volume,	1
and	1
before	1
he	1
had,	1
with	1
very	1
monotonous	1
solemnity,	1
read	1
three	1
pages,	1
she	1
interrupted	1
him	1
with:	1
"Do	1
you	1
know,	1
mamma,	1
that	1
my	1
uncle	1
Phillips	1
talks	1
of	1
turning	1
away	1
Richard;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
does,	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
will	1
hire	1
him.	1
My	1
aunt	1
told	1
me	1
so	1
herself	1
on	1
Saturday.	1
I	1
shall	1
walk	1
to	1
Meryton	1
to-morrow	1
to	1
hear	1
more	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
ask	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Denny	1
comes	1
back	1
from	1
town."	1
Lydia	1
was	1
bid	1
by	1
her	1
two	1
eldest	1
sisters	1
to	1
hold	1
her	1
tongue;	1
but	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
much	1
offended,	1
laid	1
aside	1
his	1
book,	1
and	1
said:	1
"I	1
have	1
often	1
observed	1
how	1
little	1
young	1
ladies	1
are	1
interested	1
by	1
books	1
of	1
a	1
serious	1
stamp,	1
though	1
written	1
solely	1
for	1
their	1
benefit.	1
It	1
amazes	1
me,	1
I	1
confess;	1
for,	1
certainly,	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
nothing	1
so	1
advantageous	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
instruction.	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
no	1
longer	1
importune	1
my	1
young	1
cousin."	1
Then	1
turning	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
he	1
offered	1
himself	1
as	1
his	1
antagonist	1
at	1
backgammon.	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
accepted	1
the	1
challenge,	1
observing	1
that	1
he	1
acted	1
very	1
wisely	1
in	1
leaving	1
the	1
girls	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
trifling	1
amusements.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
and	1
her	1
daughters	1
apologised	1
most	1
civilly	1
for	1
Lydia's	1
interruption,	1
and	1
promised	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
occur	1
again,	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
resume	1
his	1
book;	1
but	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
after	1
assuring	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
bore	1
his	1
young	1
cousin	1
no	1
ill-will,	1
and	1
should	1
never	1
resent	1
her	1
behaviour	1
as	1
any	1
affront,	1
seated	1
himself	1
at	1
another	1
table	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
and	1
prepared	1
for	1
backgammon.	1
Chapter	1
15	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
sensible	1
man,	1
and	1
the	1
deficiency	1
of	1
nature	1
had	1
been	1
but	1
little	1
assisted	1
by	1
education	1
or	1
society;	1
the	1
greatest	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
having	1
been	1
spent	1
under	1
the	1
guidance	1
of	1
an	1
illiterate	1
and	1
miserly	1
father;	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
belonged	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
universities,	1
he	1
had	1
merely	1
kept	1
the	1
necessary	1
terms,	1
without	1
forming	1
at	1
it	1
any	1
useful	1
acquaintance.	1
The	1
subjection	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
up	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
originally	1
great	1
humility	1
of	1
manner;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
counteracted	1
by	1
the	1
self-conceit	1
of	1
a	1
weak	1
head,	1
living	1
in	1
retirement,	1
and	1
the	1
consequential	1
feelings	1
of	1
early	1
and	1
unexpected	1
prosperity.	1
A	1
fortunate	1
chance	1
had	1
recommended	1
him	1
to	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
when	1
the	1
living	1
of	1
Hunsford	1
was	1
vacant;	1
and	1
the	1
respect	1
which	1
he	1
felt	1
for	1
her	1
high	1
rank,	1
and	1
his	1
veneration	1
for	1
her	1
as	1
his	1
patroness,	1
mingling	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
opinion	1
of	1
himself,	1
of	1
his	1
authority	1
as	1
a	1
clergyman,	1
and	1
his	1
right	1
as	1
a	1
rector,	1
made	1
him	1
altogether	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
pride	1
and	1
obsequiousness,	1
self-importance	1
and	1
humility.	1
Having	1
now	1
a	1
good	1
house	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
sufficient	1
income,	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
marry;	1
and	1
in	1
seeking	1
a	1
reconciliation	1
with	1
the	1
Longbourn	1
family	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
wife	1
in	1
view,	1
as	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
choose	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
daughters,	1
if	1
he	1
found	1
them	1
as	1
handsome	1
and	1
amiable	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
represented	1
by	1
common	1
report.	1
This	1
was	1
his	1
plan	1
of	1
amends--of	1
atonement--for	1
inheriting	1
their	1
father's	1
estate;	1
and	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
an	1
excellent	1
one,	1
full	1
of	1
eligibility	1
and	1
suitableness,	1
and	1
excessively	1
generous	1
and	1
disinterested	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
part.	1
His	1
plan	1
did	1
not	1
vary	1
on	1
seeing	1
them.	1
Miss	1
Bennet's	1
lovely	1
face	1
confirmed	1
his	1
views,	1
and	1
established	1
all	1
his	1
strictest	1
notions	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
seniority;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
evening	1
_she_	1
was	1
his	1
settled	1
choice.	1
The	1
next	1
morning,	1
however,	1
made	1
an	1
alteration;	1
for	1
in	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour's	1
tete-a-tete	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
before	1
breakfast,	1
a	1
conversation	1
beginning	1
with	1
his	1
parsonage-house,	1
and	1
leading	1
naturally	1
to	1
the	1
avowal	1
of	1
his	1
hopes,	1
that	1
a	1
mistress	1
might	1
be	1
found	1
for	1
it	1
at	1
Longbourn,	1
produced	1
from	1
her,	1
amid	1
very	1
complaisant	1
smiles	1
and	1
general	1
encouragement,	1
a	1
caution	1
against	1
the	1
very	1
Jane	1
he	1
had	1
fixed	1
on.	1
"As	1
to	1
her	1
_younger_	1
daughters,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
take	1
upon	1
her	1
to	1
say--she	1
could	1
not	1
positively	1
answer--but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
_know_	1
of	1
any	1
prepossession;	1
her	1
_eldest_	1
daughter,	1
she	1
must	1
just	1
mention--she	1
felt	1
it	1
incumbent	1
on	1
her	1
to	1
hint,	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
soon	1
engaged."	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
change	1
from	1
Jane	1
to	1
Elizabeth--and	1
it	1
was	1
soon	1
done--done	1
while	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
stirring	1
the	1
fire.	1
Elizabeth,	1
equally	1
next	1
to	1
Jane	1
in	1
birth	1
and	1
beauty,	1
succeeded	1
her	1
of	1
course.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
treasured	1
up	1
the	1
hint,	1
and	1
trusted	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
soon	1
have	1
two	1
daughters	1
married;	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
was	1
now	1
high	1
in	1
her	1
good	1
graces.	1
Lydia's	1
intention	1
of	1
walking	1
to	1
Meryton	1
was	1
not	1
forgotten;	1
every	1
sister	1
except	1
Mary	1
agreed	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
her;	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
was	1
to	1
attend	1
them,	1
at	1
the	1
request	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
who	1
was	1
most	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
have	1
his	1
library	1
to	1
himself;	1
for	1
thither	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
had	1
followed	1
him	1
after	1
breakfast;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
would	1
continue,	1
nominally	1
engaged	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
folios	1
in	1
the	1
collection,	1
but	1
really	1
talking	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
with	1
little	1
cessation,	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
garden	1
at	1
Hunsford.	1
Such	1
doings	1
discomposed	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
exceedingly.	1
In	1
his	1
library	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
always	1
sure	1
of	1
leisure	1
and	1
tranquillity;	1
and	1
though	1
prepared,	1
as	1
he	1
told	1
Elizabeth,	1
to	1
meet	1
with	1
folly	1
and	1
conceit	1
in	1
every	1
other	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
was	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
free	1
from	1
them	1
there;	1
his	1
civility,	1
therefore,	1
was	1
most	1
prompt	1
in	1
inviting	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
to	1
join	1
his	1
daughters	1
in	1
their	1
walk;	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
being	1
in	1
fact	1
much	1
better	1
fitted	1
for	1
a	1
walker	1
than	1
a	1
reader,	1
was	1
extremely	1
pleased	1
to	1
close	1
his	1
large	1
book,	1
and	1
go.	1
In	1
pompous	1
nothings	1
on	1
his	1
side,	1
and	1
civil	1
assents	1
on	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
cousins,	1
their	1
time	1
passed	1
till	1
they	1
entered	1
Meryton.	1
The	1
attention	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
ones	1
was	1
then	1
no	1
longer	1
to	1
be	1
gained	1
by	1
him.	1
Their	1
eyes	1
were	1
immediately	1
wandering	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
the	1
officers,	1
and	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
very	1
smart	1
bonnet	1
indeed,	1
or	1
a	1
really	1
new	1
muslin	1
in	1
a	1
shop	1
window,	1
could	1
recall	1
them.	1
But	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
every	1
lady	1
was	1
soon	1
caught	1
by	1
a	1
young	1
man,	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
before,	1
of	1
most	1
gentlemanlike	1
appearance,	1
walking	1
with	1
another	1
officer	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
way.	1
The	1
officer	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
Mr.	1
Denny	1
concerning	1
whose	1
return	1
from	1
London	1
Lydia	1
came	1
to	1
inquire,	1
and	1
he	1
bowed	1
as	1
they	1
passed.	1
All	1
were	1
struck	1
with	1
the	1
stranger's	1
air,	1
all	1
wondered	1
who	1
he	1
could	1
be;	1
and	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Lydia,	1
determined	1
if	1
possible	1
to	1
find	1
out,	1
led	1
the	1
way	1
across	1
the	1
street,	1
under	1
pretense	1
of	1
wanting	1
something	1
in	1
an	1
opposite	1
shop,	1
and	1
fortunately	1
had	1
just	1
gained	1
the	1
pavement	1
when	1
the	1
two	1
gentlemen,	1
turning	1
back,	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
same	1
spot.	1
Mr.	1
Denny	1
addressed	1
them	1
directly,	1
and	1
entreated	1
permission	1
to	1
introduce	1
his	1
friend,	1
Mr.	1
Wickham,	1
who	1
had	1
returned	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
from	1
town,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
happy	1
to	1
say	1
had	1
accepted	1
a	1
commission	1
in	1
their	1
corps.	1
This	1
was	1
exactly	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
be;	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
wanted	1
only	1
regimentals	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
completely	1
charming.	1
His	1
appearance	1
was	1
greatly	1
in	1
his	1
favour;	1
he	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
best	1
part	1
of	1
beauty,	1
a	1
fine	1
countenance,	1
a	1
good	1
figure,	1
and	1
very	1
pleasing	1
address.	1
The	1
introduction	1
was	1
followed	1
up	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
by	1
a	1
happy	1
readiness	1
of	1
conversation--a	1
readiness	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
perfectly	1
correct	1
and	1
unassuming;	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
were	1
still	1
standing	1
and	1
talking	1
together	1
very	1
agreeably,	1
when	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
horses	1
drew	1
their	1
notice,	1
and	1
Darcy	1
and	1
Bingley	1
were	1
seen	1
riding	1
down	1
the	1
street.	1
On	1
distinguishing	1
the	1
ladies	1
of	1
the	1
group,	1
the	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
came	1
directly	1
towards	1
them,	1
and	1
began	1
the	1
usual	1
civilities.	1
Bingley	1
was	1
the	1
principal	1
spokesman,	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
the	1
principal	1
object.	1
He	1
was	1
then,	1
he	1
said,	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
Longbourn	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
inquire	1
after	1
her.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
corroborated	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
bow,	1
and	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
determine	1
not	1
to	1
fix	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
Elizabeth,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
suddenly	1
arrested	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
stranger,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
happening	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
both	1
as	1
they	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other,	1
was	1
all	1
astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
meeting.	1
Both	1
changed	1
colour,	1
one	1
looked	1
white,	1
the	1
other	1
red.	1
Mr.	1
Wickham,	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
moments,	1
touched	1
his	1
hat--a	1
salutation	1
which	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
just	1
deigned	1
to	1
return.	1
What	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
it?	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
imagine;	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
long	1
to	1
know.	1
In	1
another	1
minute,	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
but	1
without	1
seeming	1
to	1
have	1
noticed	1
what	1
passed,	1
took	1
leave	1
and	1
rode	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
friend.	1
Mr.	1
Denny	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
walked	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Phillip's	1
house,	1
and	1
then	1
made	1
their	1
bows,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
Miss	1
Lydia's	1
pressing	1
entreaties	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
come	1
in,	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips's	1
throwing	1
up	1
the	1
parlour	1
window	1
and	1
loudly	1
seconding	1
the	1
invitation.	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips	1
was	1
always	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
nieces;	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
eldest,	1
from	1
their	1
recent	1
absence,	1
were	1
particularly	1
welcome,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
eagerly	1
expressing	1
her	1
surprise	1
at	1
their	1
sudden	1
return	1
home,	1
which,	1
as	1
their	1
own	1
carriage	1
had	1
not	1
fetched	1
them,	1
she	1
should	1
have	1
known	1
nothing	1
about,	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
happened	1
to	1
see	1
Mr.	1
Jones's	1
shop-boy	1
in	1
the	1
street,	1
who	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
send	1
any	1
more	1
draughts	1
to	1
Netherfield	1
because	1
the	1
Miss	1
Bennets	1
were	1
come	1
away,	1
when	1
her	1
civility	1
was	1
claimed	1
towards	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
by	1
Jane's	1
introduction	1
of	1
him.	1
She	1
received	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
very	1
best	1
politeness,	1
which	1
he	1
returned	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
more,	1
apologising	1
for	1
his	1
intrusion,	1
without	1
any	1
previous	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
her,	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
flattering	1
himself,	1
however,	1
might	1
be	1
justified	1
by	1
his	1
relationship	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
who	1
introduced	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
notice.	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips	1
was	1
quite	1
awed	1
by	1
such	1
an	1
excess	1
of	1
good	1
breeding;	1
but	1
her	1
contemplation	1
of	1
one	1
stranger	1
was	1
soon	1
put	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
by	1
exclamations	1
and	1
inquiries	1
about	1
the	1
other;	1
of	1
whom,	1
however,	1
she	1
could	1
only	1
tell	1
her	1
nieces	1
what	1
they	1
already	1
knew,	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Denny	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
from	1
London,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
lieutenant's	1
commission	1
in	1
the	1
----shire.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
watching	1
him	1
the	1
last	1
hour,	1
she	1
said,	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
street,	1
and	1
had	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
appeared,	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Lydia	1
would	1
certainly	1
have	1
continued	1
the	1
occupation,	1
but	1
unluckily	1
no	1
one	1
passed	1
windows	1
now	1
except	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
officers,	1
who,	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
stranger,	1
were	1
become	1
"stupid,	1
disagreeable	1
fellows."	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
the	1
Phillipses	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
and	1
their	1
aunt	1
promised	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
husband	1
call	1
on	1
Mr.	1
Wickham,	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
an	1
invitation	1
also,	1
if	1
the	1
family	1
from	1
Longbourn	1
would	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
evening.	1
This	1
was	1
agreed	1
to,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips	1
protested	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
nice	1
comfortable	1
noisy	1
game	1
of	1
lottery	1
tickets,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
of	1
hot	1
supper	1
afterwards.	1
The	1
prospect	1
of	1
such	1
delights	1
was	1
very	1
cheering,	1
and	1
they	1
parted	1
in	1
mutual	1
good	1
spirits.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
repeated	1
his	1
apologies	1
in	1
quitting	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
was	1
assured	1
with	1
unwearying	1
civility	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
perfectly	1
needless.	1
As	1
they	1
walked	1
home,	1
Elizabeth	1
related	1
to	1
Jane	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
pass	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
gentlemen;	1
but	1
though	1
Jane	1
would	1
have	1
defended	1
either	1
or	1
both,	1
had	1
they	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
wrong,	1
she	1
could	1
no	1
more	1
explain	1
such	1
behaviour	1
than	1
her	1
sister.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
on	1
his	1
return	1
highly	1
gratified	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
by	1
admiring	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips's	1
manners	1
and	1
politeness.	1
He	1
protested	1
that,	1
except	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
and	1
her	1
daughter,	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
a	1
more	1
elegant	1
woman;	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
only	1
received	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
civility,	1
but	1
even	1
pointedly	1
included	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
invitation	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
evening,	1
although	1
utterly	1
unknown	1
to	1
her	1
before.	1
Something,	1
he	1
supposed,	1
might	1
be	1
attributed	1
to	1
his	1
connection	1
with	1
them,	1
but	1
yet	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
met	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
attention	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
Chapter	1
16	1
As	1
no	1
objection	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
people's	1
engagement	1
with	1
their	1
aunt,	1
and	1
all	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
scruples	1
of	1
leaving	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
evening	1
during	1
his	1
visit	1
were	1
most	1
steadily	1
resisted,	1
the	1
coach	1
conveyed	1
him	1
and	1
his	1
five	1
cousins	1
at	1
a	1
suitable	1
hour	1
to	1
Meryton;	1
and	1
the	1
girls	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
hearing,	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
had	1
accepted	1
their	1
uncle's	1
invitation,	1
and	1
was	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
When	1
this	1
information	1
was	1
given,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
taken	1
their	1
seats,	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
was	1
at	1
leisure	1
to	1
look	1
around	1
him	1
and	1
admire,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
struck	1
with	1
the	1
size	1
and	1
furniture	1
of	1
the	1
apartment,	1
that	1
he	1
declared	1
he	1
might	1
almost	1
have	1
supposed	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
summer	1
breakfast	1
parlour	1
at	1
Rosings;	1
a	1
comparison	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
convey	1
much	1
gratification;	1
but	1
when	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips	1
understood	1
from	1
him	1
what	1
Rosings	1
was,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
its	1
proprietor--when	1
she	1
had	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
description	1
of	1
only	1
one	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine's	1
drawing-rooms,	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
chimney-piece	1
alone	1
had	1
cost	1
eight	1
hundred	1
pounds,	1
she	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
compliment,	1
and	1
would	1
hardly	1
have	1
resented	1
a	1
comparison	1
with	1
the	1
housekeeper's	1
room.	1
In	1
describing	1
to	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
grandeur	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
and	1
her	1
mansion,	1
with	1
occasional	1
digressions	1
in	1
praise	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
humble	1
abode,	1
and	1
the	1
improvements	1
it	1
was	1
receiving,	1
he	1
was	1
happily	1
employed	1
until	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
joined	1
them;	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
in	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips	1
a	1
very	1
attentive	1
listener,	1
whose	1
opinion	1
of	1
his	1
consequence	1
increased	1
with	1
what	1
she	1
heard,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
resolving	1
to	1
retail	1
it	1
all	1
among	1
her	1
neighbours	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
could.	1
To	1
the	1
girls,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
listen	1
to	1
their	1
cousin,	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
to	1
wish	1
for	1
an	1
instrument,	1
and	1
examine	1
their	1
own	1
indifferent	1
imitations	1
of	1
china	1
on	1
the	1
mantelpiece,	1
the	1
interval	1
of	1
waiting	1
appeared	1
very	1
long.	1
It	1
was	1
over	1
at	1
last,	1
however.	1
The	1
gentlemen	1
did	1
approach,	1
and	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
room,	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
neither	1
been	1
seeing	1
him	1
before,	1
nor	1
thinking	1
of	1
him	1
since,	1
with	1
the	1
smallest	1
degree	1
of	1
unreasonable	1
admiration.	1
The	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
----shire	1
were	1
in	1
general	1
a	1
very	1
creditable,	1
gentlemanlike	1
set,	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
party;	1
but	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
was	1
as	1
far	1
beyond	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
person,	1
countenance,	1
air,	1
and	1
walk,	1
as	1
_they_	1
were	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
broad-faced,	1
stuffy	1
uncle	1
Phillips,	1
breathing	1
port	1
wine,	1
who	1
followed	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
was	1
the	1
happy	1
man	1
towards	1
whom	1
almost	1
every	1
female	1
eye	1
was	1
turned,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
the	1
happy	1
woman	1
by	1
whom	1
he	1
finally	1
seated	1
himself;	1
and	1
the	1
agreeable	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
immediately	1
fell	1
into	1
conversation,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
on	1
its	1
being	1
a	1
wet	1
night,	1
made	1
her	1
feel	1
that	1
the	1
commonest,	1
dullest,	1
most	1
threadbare	1
topic	1
might	1
be	1
rendered	1
interesting	1
by	1
the	1
skill	1
of	1
the	1
speaker.	1
With	1
such	1
rivals	1
for	1
the	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
and	1
the	1
officers,	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
seemed	1
to	1
sink	1
into	1
insignificance;	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
he	1
certainly	1
was	1
nothing;	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
still	1
at	1
intervals	1
a	1
kind	1
listener	1
in	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips,	1
and	1
was	1
by	1
her	1
watchfulness,	1
most	1
abundantly	1
supplied	1
with	1
coffee	1
and	1
muffin.	1
When	1
the	1
card-tables	1
were	1
placed,	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
obliging	1
her	1
in	1
turn,	1
by	1
sitting	1
down	1
to	1
whist.	1
"I	1
know	1
little	1
of	1
the	1
game	1
at	1
present,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"but	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
improve	1
myself,	1
for	1
in	1
my	1
situation	1
in	1
life--"	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
for	1
his	1
compliance,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
wait	1
for	1
his	1
reason.	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
did	1
not	1
play	1
at	1
whist,	1
and	1
with	1
ready	1
delight	1
was	1
he	1
received	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
table	1
between	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
Lydia.	1
At	1
first	1
there	1
seemed	1
danger	1
of	1
Lydia's	1
engrossing	1
him	1
entirely,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
determined	1
talker;	1
but	1
being	1
likewise	1
extremely	1
fond	1
of	1
lottery	1
tickets,	1
she	1
soon	1
grew	1
too	1
much	1
interested	1
in	1
the	1
game,	1
too	1
eager	1
in	1
making	1
bets	1
and	1
exclaiming	1
after	1
prizes	1
to	1
have	1
attention	1
for	1
anyone	1
in	1
particular.	1
Allowing	1
for	1
the	1
common	1
demands	1
of	1
the	1
game,	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
was	1
therefore	1
at	1
leisure	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
Elizabeth,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
willing	1
to	1
hear	1
him,	1
though	1
what	1
she	1
chiefly	1
wished	1
to	1
hear	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
hope	1
to	1
be	1
told--the	1
history	1
of	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Darcy.	1
She	1
dared	1
not	1
even	1
mention	1
that	1
gentleman.	1
Her	1
curiosity,	1
however,	1
was	1
unexpectedly	1
relieved.	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
began	1
the	1
subject	1
himself.	1
He	1
inquired	1
how	1
far	1
Netherfield	1
was	1
from	1
Meryton;	1
and,	1
after	1
receiving	1
her	1
answer,	1
asked	1
in	1
a	1
hesitating	1
manner	1
how	1
long	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
had	1
been	1
staying	1
there.	1
"About	1
a	1
month,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth;	1
and	1
then,	1
unwilling	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
subject	1
drop,	1
added,	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
very	1
large	1
property	1
in	1
Derbyshire,	1
I	1
understand."	1
"Yes,"	1
replied	1
Mr.	1
Wickham;	1
"his	1
estate	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
noble	1
one.	1
A	1
clear	1
ten	1
thousand	1
per	1
annum.	1
You	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
met	1
with	1
a	1
person	1
more	1
capable	1
of	1
giving	1
you	1
certain	1
information	1
on	1
that	1
head	1
than	1
myself,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
connected	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
in	1
a	1
particular	1
manner	1
from	1
my	1
infancy."	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
look	1
surprised.	1
"You	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
surprised,	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
at	1
such	1
an	1
assertion,	1
after	1
seeing,	1
as	1
you	1
probably	1
might,	1
the	1
very	1
cold	1
manner	1
of	1
our	1
meeting	1
yesterday.	1
Are	1
you	1
much	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Darcy?"	1
"As	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
ever	1
wish	1
to	1
be,"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth	1
very	1
warmly.	1
"I	1
have	1
spent	1
four	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
him	1
very	1
disagreeable."	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
give	1
_my_	1
opinion,"	1
said	1
Wickham,	1
"as	1
to	1
his	1
being	1
agreeable	1
or	1
otherwise.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
qualified	1
to	1
form	1
one.	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
too	1
long	1
and	1
too	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
fair	1
judge.	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
_me_	1
to	1
be	1
impartial.	1
But	1
I	1
believe	1
your	1
opinion	1
of	1
him	1
would	1
in	1
general	1
astonish--and	1
perhaps	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
express	1
it	1
quite	1
so	1
strongly	1
anywhere	1
else.	1
Here	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
family."	1
"Upon	1
my	1
word,	1
I	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
_here_	1
than	1
I	1
might	1
say	1
in	1
any	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
except	1
Netherfield.	1
He	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
liked	1
in	1
Hertfordshire.	1
Everybody	1
is	1
disgusted	1
with	1
his	1
pride.	1
You	1
will	1
not	1
find	1
him	1
more	1
favourably	1
spoken	1
of	1
by	1
anyone."	1
"I	1
cannot	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
sorry,"	1
said	1
Wickham,	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
interruption,	1
"that	1
he	1
or	1
that	1
any	1
man	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
estimated	1
beyond	1
their	1
deserts;	1
but	1
with	1
_him_	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
often	1
happen.	1
The	1
world	1
is	1
blinded	1
by	1
his	1
fortune	1
and	1
consequence,	1
or	1
frightened	1
by	1
his	1
high	1
and	1
imposing	1
manners,	1
and	1
sees	1
him	1
only	1
as	1
he	1
chooses	1
to	1
be	1
seen."	1
"I	1
should	1
take	1
him,	1
even	1
on	1
_my_	1
slight	1
acquaintance,	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
ill-tempered	1
man."	1
Wickham	1
only	1
shook	1
his	1
head.	1
"I	1
wonder,"	1
said	1
he,	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
opportunity	1
of	1
speaking,	1
"whether	1
he	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
this	1
country	1
much	1
longer."	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
know;	1
but	1
I	1
_heard_	1
nothing	1
of	1
his	1
going	1
away	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
at	1
Netherfield.	1
I	1
hope	1
your	1
plans	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
the	1
----shire	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
affected	1
by	1
his	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood."	1
"Oh!	1
no--it	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
_me_	1
to	1
be	1
driven	1
away	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Darcy.	1
If	1
_he_	1
wishes	1
to	1
avoid	1
seeing	1
_me_,	1
he	1
must	1
go.	1
We	1
are	1
not	1
on	1
friendly	1
terms,	1
and	1
it	1
always	1
gives	1
me	1
pain	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
reason	1
for	1
avoiding	1
_him_	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
might	1
proclaim	1
before	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
very	1
great	1
ill-usage,	1
and	1
most	1
painful	1
regrets	1
at	1
his	1
being	1
what	1
he	1
is.	1
His	1
father,	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
the	1
late	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
men	1
that	1
ever	1
breathed,	1
and	1
the	1
truest	1
friend	1
I	1
ever	1
had;	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
this	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
without	1
being	1
grieved	1
to	1
the	1
soul	1
by	1
a	1
thousand	1
tender	1
recollections.	1
His	1
behaviour	1
to	1
myself	1
has	1
been	1
scandalous;	1
but	1
I	1
verily	1
believe	1
I	1
could	1
forgive	1
him	1
anything	1
and	1
everything,	1
rather	1
than	1
his	1
disappointing	1
the	1
hopes	1
and	1
disgracing	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
his	1
father."	1
Elizabeth	1
found	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
the	1
subject	1
increase,	1
and	1
listened	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
heart;	1
but	1
the	1
delicacy	1
of	1
it	1
prevented	1
further	1
inquiry.	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
began	1
to	1
speak	1
on	1
more	1
general	1
topics,	1
Meryton,	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
the	1
society,	1
appearing	1
highly	1
pleased	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
yet	1
seen,	1
and	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
with	1
gentle	1
but	1
very	1
intelligible	1
gallantry.	1
"It	1
was	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
constant	1
society,	1
and	1
good	1
society,"	1
he	1
added,	1
"which	1
was	1
my	1
chief	1
inducement	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
----shire.	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
most	1
respectable,	1
agreeable	1
corps,	1
and	1
my	1
friend	1
Denny	1
tempted	1
me	1
further	1
by	1
his	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
present	1
quarters,	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
great	1
attentions	1
and	1
excellent	1
acquaintances	1
Meryton	1
had	1
procured	1
them.	1
Society,	1
I	1
own,	1
is	1
necessary	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
disappointed	1
man,	1
and	1
my	1
spirits	1
will	1
not	1
bear	1
solitude.	1
I	1
_must_	1
have	1
employment	1
and	1
society.	1
A	1
military	1
life	1
is	1
not	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
intended	1
for,	1
but	1
circumstances	1
have	1
now	1
made	1
it	1
eligible.	1
The	1
church	1
_ought_	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
my	1
profession--I	1
was	1
brought	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
valuable	1
living,	1
had	1
it	1
pleased	1
the	1
gentleman	1
we	1
were	1
speaking	1
of	1
just	1
now."	1
"Indeed!"	1
"Yes--the	1
late	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
bequeathed	1
me	1
the	1
next	1
presentation	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
living	1
in	1
his	1
gift.	1
He	1
was	1
my	1
godfather,	1
and	1
excessively	1
attached	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
cannot	1
do	1
justice	1
to	1
his	1
kindness.	1
He	1
meant	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
me	1
amply,	1
and	1
thought	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
it;	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
living	1
fell,	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
elsewhere."	1
"Good	1
heavens!"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth;	1
"but	1
how	1
could	1
_that_	1
be?	1
How	1
could	1
his	1
will	1
be	1
disregarded?	1
Why	1
did	1
you	1
not	1
seek	1
legal	1
redress?"	1
"There	1
was	1
just	1
such	1
an	1
informality	1
in	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
bequest	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
no	1
hope	1
from	1
law.	1
A	1
man	1
of	1
honour	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
doubted	1
the	1
intention,	1
but	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
chose	1
to	1
doubt	1
it--or	1
to	1
treat	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
merely	1
conditional	1
recommendation,	1
and	1
to	1
assert	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
forfeited	1
all	1
claim	1
to	1
it	1
by	1
extravagance,	1
imprudence--in	1
short	1
anything	1
or	1
nothing.	1
Certain	1
it	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
living	1
became	1
vacant	1
two	1
years	1
ago,	1
exactly	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
of	1
an	1
age	1
to	1
hold	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
another	1
man;	1
and	1
no	1
less	1
certain	1
is	1
it,	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
accuse	1
myself	1
of	1
having	1
really	1
done	1
anything	1
to	1
deserve	1
to	1
lose	1
it.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
warm,	1
unguarded	1
temper,	1
and	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
spoken	1
my	1
opinion	1
_of_	1
him,	1
and	1
_to_	1
him,	1
too	1
freely.	1
I	1
can	1
recall	1
nothing	1
worse.	1
But	1
the	1
fact	1
is,	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
very	1
different	1
sort	1
of	1
men,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
hates	1
me."	1
"This	1
is	1
quite	1
shocking!	1
He	1
deserves	1
to	1
be	1
publicly	1
disgraced."	1
"Some	1
time	1
or	1
other	1
he	1
_will_	1
be--but	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
by	1
_me_.	1
Till	1
I	1
can	1
forget	1
his	1
father,	1
I	1
can	1
never	1
defy	1
or	1
expose	1
_him_."	1
Elizabeth	1
honoured	1
him	1
for	1
such	1
feelings,	1
and	1
thought	1
him	1
handsomer	1
than	1
ever	1
as	1
he	1
expressed	1
them.	1
"But	1
what,"	1
said	1
she,	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
"can	1
have	1
been	1
his	1
motive?	1
What	1
can	1
have	1
induced	1
him	1
to	1
behave	1
so	1
cruelly?"	1
"A	1
thorough,	1
determined	1
dislike	1
of	1
me--a	1
dislike	1
which	1
I	1
cannot	1
but	1
attribute	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
to	1
jealousy.	1
Had	1
the	1
late	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
liked	1
me	1
less,	1
his	1
son	1
might	1
have	1
borne	1
with	1
me	1
better;	1
but	1
his	1
father's	1
uncommon	1
attachment	1
to	1
me	1
irritated	1
him,	1
I	1
believe,	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
life.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
temper	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
competition	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
stood--the	1
sort	1
of	1
preference	1
which	1
was	1
often	1
given	1
me."	1
"I	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
so	1
bad	1
as	1
this--though	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
liked	1
him.	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
so	1
very	1
ill	1
of	1
him.	1
I	1
had	1
supposed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
despising	1
his	1
fellow-creatures	1
in	1
general,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
suspect	1
him	1
of	1
descending	1
to	1
such	1
malicious	1
revenge,	1
such	1
injustice,	1
such	1
inhumanity	1
as	1
this."	1
After	1
a	1
few	1
minutes'	1
reflection,	1
however,	1
she	1
continued,	1
"I	1
_do_	1
remember	1
his	1
boasting	1
one	1
day,	1
at	1
Netherfield,	1
of	1
the	1
implacability	1
of	1
his	1
resentments,	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
an	1
unforgiving	1
temper.	1
His	1
disposition	1
must	1
be	1
dreadful."	1
"I	1
will	1
not	1
trust	1
myself	1
on	1
the	1
subject,"	1
replied	1
Wickham;	1
"I	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
just	1
to	1
him."	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
again	1
deep	1
in	1
thought,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
time	1
exclaimed,	1
"To	1
treat	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
the	1
godson,	1
the	1
friend,	1
the	1
favourite	1
of	1
his	1
father!"	1
She	1
could	1
have	1
added,	1
"A	1
young	1
man,	1
too,	1
like	1
_you_,	1
whose	1
very	1
countenance	1
may	1
vouch	1
for	1
your	1
being	1
amiable"--but	1
she	1
contented	1
herself	1
with,	1
"and	1
one,	1
too,	1
who	1
had	1
probably	1
been	1
his	1
companion	1
from	1
childhood,	1
connected	1
together,	1
as	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
said,	1
in	1
the	1
closest	1
manner!"	1
"We	1
were	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
parish,	1
within	1
the	1
same	1
park;	1
the	1
greatest	1
part	1
of	1
our	1
youth	1
was	1
passed	1
together;	1
inmates	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
house,	1
sharing	1
the	1
same	1
amusements,	1
objects	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
parental	1
care.	1
_My_	1
father	1
began	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
profession	1
which	1
your	1
uncle,	1
Mr.	1
Phillips,	1
appears	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
much	1
credit	1
to--but	1
he	1
gave	1
up	1
everything	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
the	1
late	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
and	1
devoted	1
all	1
his	1
time	1
to	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
Pemberley	1
property.	1
He	1
was	1
most	1
highly	1
esteemed	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
a	1
most	1
intimate,	1
confidential	1
friend.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
often	1
acknowledged	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
the	1
greatest	1
obligations	1
to	1
my	1
father's	1
active	1
superintendence,	1
and	1
when,	1
immediately	1
before	1
my	1
father's	1
death,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
voluntary	1
promise	1
of	1
providing	1
for	1
me,	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
debt	1
of	1
gratitude	1
to	1
_him_,	1
as	1
of	1
his	1
affection	1
to	1
myself."	1
"How	1
strange!"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth.	1
"How	1
abominable!	1
I	1
wonder	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
pride	1
of	1
this	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
has	1
not	1
made	1
him	1
just	1
to	1
you!	1
If	1
from	1
no	1
better	1
motive,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
too	1
proud	1
to	1
be	1
dishonest--for	1
dishonesty	1
I	1
must	1
call	1
it."	1
"It	1
_is_	1
wonderful,"	1
replied	1
Wickham,	1
"for	1
almost	1
all	1
his	1
actions	1
may	1
be	1
traced	1
to	1
pride;	1
and	1
pride	1
had	1
often	1
been	1
his	1
best	1
friend.	1
It	1
has	1
connected	1
him	1
nearer	1
with	1
virtue	1
than	1
with	1
any	1
other	1
feeling.	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
consistent,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
me	1
there	1
were	1
stronger	1
impulses	1
even	1
than	1
pride."	1
"Can	1
such	1
abominable	1
pride	1
as	1
his	1
have	1
ever	1
done	1
him	1
good?"	1
"Yes.	1
It	1
has	1
often	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
liberal	1
and	1
generous,	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
money	1
freely,	1
to	1
display	1
hospitality,	1
to	1
assist	1
his	1
tenants,	1
and	1
relieve	1
the	1
poor.	1
Family	1
pride,	1
and	1
_filial_	1
pride--for	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
proud	1
of	1
what	1
his	1
father	1
was--have	1
done	1
this.	1
Not	1
to	1
appear	1
to	1
disgrace	1
his	1
family,	1
to	1
degenerate	1
from	1
the	1
popular	1
qualities,	1
or	1
lose	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
Pemberley	1
House,	1
is	1
a	1
powerful	1
motive.	1
He	1
has	1
also	1
_brotherly_	1
pride,	1
which,	1
with	1
_some_	1
brotherly	1
affection,	1
makes	1
him	1
a	1
very	1
kind	1
and	1
careful	1
guardian	1
of	1
his	1
sister,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
hear	1
him	1
generally	1
cried	1
up	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
attentive	1
and	1
best	1
of	1
brothers."	1
"What	1
sort	1
of	1
girl	1
is	1
Miss	1
Darcy?"	1
He	1
shook	1
his	1
head.	1
"I	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
call	1
her	1
amiable.	1
It	1
gives	1
me	1
pain	1
to	1
speak	1
ill	1
of	1
a	1
Darcy.	1
But	1
she	1
is	1
too	1
much	1
like	1
her	1
brother--very,	1
very	1
proud.	1
As	1
a	1
child,	1
she	1
was	1
affectionate	1
and	1
pleasing,	1
and	1
extremely	1
fond	1
of	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
devoted	1
hours	1
and	1
hours	1
to	1
her	1
amusement.	1
But	1
she	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
me	1
now.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
handsome	1
girl,	1
about	1
fifteen	1
or	1
sixteen,	1
and,	1
I	1
understand,	1
highly	1
accomplished.	1
Since	1
her	1
father's	1
death,	1
her	1
home	1
has	1
been	1
London,	1
where	1
a	1
lady	1
lives	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
superintends	1
her	1
education."	1
After	1
many	1
pauses	1
and	1
many	1
trials	1
of	1
other	1
subjects,	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
reverting	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
saying:	1
"I	1
am	1
astonished	1
at	1
his	1
intimacy	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Bingley!	1
How	1
can	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
who	1
seems	1
good	1
humour	1
itself,	1
and	1
is,	1
I	1
really	1
believe,	1
truly	1
amiable,	1
be	1
in	1
friendship	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
man?	1
How	1
can	1
they	1
suit	1
each	1
other?	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
Mr.	1
Bingley?"	1
"Not	1
at	1
all."	1
"He	1
is	1
a	1
sweet-tempered,	1
amiable,	1
charming	1
man.	1
He	1
cannot	1
know	1
what	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
is."	1
"Probably	1
not;	1
but	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
can	1
please	1
where	1
he	1
chooses.	1
He	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
abilities.	1
He	1
can	1
be	1
a	1
conversible	1
companion	1
if	1
he	1
thinks	1
it	1
worth	1
his	1
while.	1
Among	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
at	1
all	1
his	1
equals	1
in	1
consequence,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
man	1
from	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
less	1
prosperous.	1
His	1
pride	1
never	1
deserts	1
him;	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
rich	1
he	1
is	1
liberal-minded,	1
just,	1
sincere,	1
rational,	1
honourable,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
agreeable--allowing	1
something	1
for	1
fortune	1
and	1
figure."	1
The	1
whist	1
party	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
breaking	1
up,	1
the	1
players	1
gathered	1
round	1
the	1
other	1
table	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
took	1
his	1
station	1
between	1
his	1
cousin	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips.	1
The	1
usual	1
inquiries	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
success	1
was	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
latter.	1
It	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
very	1
great;	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
every	1
point;	1
but	1
when	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips	1
began	1
to	1
express	1
her	1
concern	1
thereupon,	1
he	1
assured	1
her	1
with	1
much	1
earnest	1
gravity	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
least	1
importance,	1
that	1
he	1
considered	1
the	1
money	1
as	1
a	1
mere	1
trifle,	1
and	1
begged	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
make	1
herself	1
uneasy.	1
"I	1
know	1
very	1
well,	1
madam,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"that	1
when	1
persons	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
card-table,	1
they	1
must	1
take	1
their	1
chances	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
happily	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
in	1
such	1
circumstances	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
five	1
shillings	1
any	1
object.	1
There	1
are	1
undoubtedly	1
many	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
the	1
same,	1
but	1
thanks	1
to	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh,	1
I	1
am	1
removed	1
far	1
beyond	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
regarding	1
little	1
matters."	1
Mr.	1
Wickham's	1
attention	1
was	1
caught;	1
and	1
after	1
observing	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments,	1
he	1
asked	1
Elizabeth	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
whether	1
her	1
relation	1
was	1
very	1
intimately	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
de	1
Bourgh.	1
"Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh,"	1
she	1
replied,	1
"has	1
very	1
lately	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
living.	1
I	1
hardly	1
know	1
how	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
was	1
first	1
introduced	1
to	1
her	1
notice,	1
but	1
he	1
certainly	1
has	1
not	1
known	1
her	1
long."	1
"You	1
know	1
of	1
course	1
that	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
and	1
Lady	1
Anne	1
Darcy	1
were	1
sisters;	1
consequently	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
aunt	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
Mr.	1
Darcy."	1
"No,	1
indeed,	1
I	1
did	1
not.	1
I	1
knew	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine's	1
connections.	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
her	1
existence	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday."	1
"Her	1
daughter,	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh,	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
fortune,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
believed	1
that	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
cousin	1
will	1
unite	1
the	1
two	1
estates."	1
This	1
information	1
made	1
Elizabeth	1
smile,	1
as	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
poor	1
Miss	1
Bingley.	1
Vain	1
indeed	1
must	1
be	1
all	1
her	1
attentions,	1
vain	1
and	1
useless	1
her	1
affection	1
for	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
her	1
praise	1
of	1
himself,	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
already	1
self-destined	1
for	1
another.	1
"Mr.	1
Collins,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"speaks	1
highly	1
both	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
and	1
her	1
daughter;	1
but	1
from	1
some	1
particulars	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
related	1
of	1
her	1
ladyship,	1
I	1
suspect	1
his	1
gratitude	1
misleads	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
his	1
patroness,	1
she	1
is	1
an	1
arrogant,	1
conceited	1
woman."	1
"I	1
believe	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
both	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
degree,"	1
replied	1
Wickham;	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
for	1
many	1
years,	1
but	1
I	1
very	1
well	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
liked	1
her,	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
manners	1
were	1
dictatorial	1
and	1
insolent.	1
She	1
has	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
remarkably	1
sensible	1
and	1
clever;	1
but	1
I	1
rather	1
believe	1
she	1
derives	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
abilities	1
from	1
her	1
rank	1
and	1
fortune,	1
part	1
from	1
her	1
authoritative	1
manner,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
from	1
the	1
pride	1
for	1
her	1
nephew,	1
who	1
chooses	1
that	1
everyone	1
connected	1
with	1
him	1
should	1
have	1
an	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
class."	1
Elizabeth	1
allowed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
very	1
rational	1
account	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
they	1
continued	1
talking	1
together,	1
with	1
mutual	1
satisfaction	1
till	1
supper	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
cards,	1
and	1
gave	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
their	1
share	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Wickham's	1
attentions.	1
There	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
conversation	1
in	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips's	1
supper	1
party,	1
but	1
his	1
manners	1
recommended	1
him	1
to	1
everybody.	1
Whatever	1
he	1
said,	1
was	1
said	1
well;	1
and	1
whatever	1
he	1
did,	1
done	1
gracefully.	1
Elizabeth	1
went	1
away	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
full	1
of	1
him.	1
She	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Wickham,	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
her,	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
home;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
time	1
for	1
her	1
even	1
to	1
mention	1
his	1
name	1
as	1
they	1
went,	1
for	1
neither	1
Lydia	1
nor	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
were	1
once	1
silent.	1
Lydia	1
talked	1
incessantly	1
of	1
lottery	1
tickets,	1
of	1
the	1
fish	1
she	1
had	1
lost	1
and	1
the	1
fish	1
she	1
had	1
won;	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
in	1
describing	1
the	1
civility	1
of	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips,	1
protesting	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
regard	1
his	1
losses	1
at	1
whist,	1
enumerating	1
all	1
the	1
dishes	1
at	1
supper,	1
and	1
repeatedly	1
fearing	1
that	1
he	1
crowded	1
his	1
cousins,	1
had	1
more	1
to	1
say	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
well	1
manage	1
before	1
the	1
carriage	1
stopped	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
House.	1
Chapter	1
17	1
Elizabeth	1
related	1
to	1
Jane	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
and	1
herself.	1
Jane	1
listened	1
with	1
astonishment	1
and	1
concern;	1
she	1
knew	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
unworthy	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
regard;	1
and	1
yet,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
her	1
nature	1
to	1
question	1
the	1
veracity	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
such	1
amiable	1
appearance	1
as	1
Wickham.	1
The	1
possibility	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
endured	1
such	1
unkindness,	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
interest	1
all	1
her	1
tender	1
feelings;	1
and	1
nothing	1
remained	1
therefore	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
but	1
to	1
think	1
well	1
of	1
them	1
both,	1
to	1
defend	1
the	1
conduct	1
of	1
each,	1
and	1
throw	1
into	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
accident	1
or	1
mistake	1
whatever	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
otherwise	1
explained.	1
"They	1
have	1
both,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"been	1
deceived,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
or	1
other,	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
can	1
form	1
no	1
idea.	1
Interested	1
people	1
have	1
perhaps	1
misrepresented	1
each	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
It	1
is,	1
in	1
short,	1
impossible	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
conjecture	1
the	1
causes	1
or	1
circumstances	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
alienated	1
them,	1
without	1
actual	1
blame	1
on	1
either	1
side."	1
"Very	1
true,	1
indeed;	1
and	1
now,	1
my	1
dear	1
Jane,	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
got	1
to	1
say	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
the	1
interested	1
people	1
who	1
have	1
probably	1
been	1
concerned	1
in	1
the	1
business?	1
Do	1
clear	1
_them_	1
too,	1
or	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
think	1
ill	1
of	1
somebody."	1
"Laugh	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
choose,	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
laugh	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
opinion.	1
My	1
dearest	1
Lizzy,	1
do	1
but	1
consider	1
in	1
what	1
a	1
disgraceful	1
light	1
it	1
places	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
to	1
be	1
treating	1
his	1
father's	1
favourite	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner,	1
one	1
whom	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
provide	1
for.	1
It	1
is	1
impossible.	1
No	1
man	1
of	1
common	1
humanity,	1
no	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
any	1
value	1
for	1
his	1
character,	1
could	1
be	1
capable	1
of	1
it.	1
Can	1
his	1
most	1
intimate	1
friends	1
be	1
so	1
excessively	1
deceived	1
in	1
him?	1
Oh!	1
no."	1
"I	1
can	1
much	1
more	1
easily	1
believe	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
being	1
imposed	1
on,	1
than	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
should	1
invent	1
such	1
a	1
history	1
of	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
last	1
night;	1
names,	1
facts,	1
everything	1
mentioned	1
without	1
ceremony.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
so,	1
let	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
contradict	1
it.	1
Besides,	1
there	1
was	1
truth	1
in	1
his	1
looks."	1
"It	1
is	1
difficult	1
indeed--it	1
is	1
distressing.	1
One	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
think."	1
"I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon;	1
one	1
knows	1
exactly	1
what	1
to	1
think."	1
But	1
Jane	1
could	1
think	1
with	1
certainty	1
on	1
only	1
one	1
point--that	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
if	1
he	1
_had_	1
been	1
imposed	1
on,	1
would	1
have	1
much	1
to	1
suffer	1
when	1
the	1
affair	1
became	1
public.	1
The	1
two	1
young	1
ladies	1
were	1
summoned	1
from	1
the	1
shrubbery,	1
where	1
this	1
conversation	1
passed,	1
by	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
persons	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
speaking;	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
and	1
his	1
sisters	1
came	1
to	1
give	1
their	1
personal	1
invitation	1
for	1
the	1
long-expected	1
ball	1
at	1
Netherfield,	1
which	1
was	1
fixed	1
for	1
the	1
following	1
Tuesday.	1
The	1
two	1
ladies	1
were	1
delighted	1
to	1
see	1
their	1
dear	1
friend	1
again,	1
called	1
it	1
an	1
age	1
since	1
they	1
had	1
met,	1
and	1
repeatedly	1
asked	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
doing	1
with	1
herself	1
since	1
their	1
separation.	1
To	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
they	1
paid	1
little	1
attention;	1
avoiding	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible,	1
saying	1
not	1
much	1
to	1
Elizabeth,	1
and	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
others.	1
They	1
were	1
soon	1
gone	1
again,	1
rising	1
from	1
their	1
seats	1
with	1
an	1
activity	1
which	1
took	1
their	1
brother	1
by	1
surprise,	1
and	1
hurrying	1
off	1
as	1
if	1
eager	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet's	1
civilities.	1
The	1
prospect	1
of	1
the	1
Netherfield	1
ball	1
was	1
extremely	1
agreeable	1
to	1
every	1
female	1
of	1
the	1
family.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
chose	1
to	1
consider	1
it	1
as	1
given	1
in	1
compliment	1
to	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter,	1
and	1
was	1
particularly	1
flattered	1
by	1
receiving	1
the	1
invitation	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
himself,	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
ceremonious	1
card.	1
Jane	1
pictured	1
to	1
herself	1
a	1
happy	1
evening	1
in	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
her	1
two	1
friends,	1
and	1
the	1
attentions	1
of	1
her	1
brother;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
thought	1
with	1
pleasure	1
of	1
dancing	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Wickham,	1
and	1
of	1
seeing	1
a	1
confirmation	1
of	1
everything	1
in	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
look	1
and	1
behaviour.	1
The	1
happiness	1
anticipated	1
by	1
Catherine	1
and	1
Lydia	1
depended	1
less	1
on	1
any	1
single	1
event,	1
or	1
any	1
particular	1
person,	1
for	1
though	1
they	1
each,	1
like	1
Elizabeth,	1
meant	1
to	1
dance	1
half	1
the	1
evening	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Wickham,	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
the	1
only	1
partner	1
who	1
could	1
satisfy	1
them,	1
and	1
a	1
ball	1
was,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
a	1
ball.	1
And	1
even	1
Mary	1
could	1
assure	1
her	1
family	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
disinclination	1
for	1
it.	1
"While	1
I	1
can	1
have	1
my	1
mornings	1
to	1
myself,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"it	1
is	1
enough--I	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
join	1
occasionally	1
in	1
evening	1
engagements.	1
Society	1
has	1
claims	1
on	1
us	1
all;	1
and	1
I	1
profess	1
myself	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
consider	1
intervals	1
of	1
recreation	1
and	1
amusement	1
as	1
desirable	1
for	1
everybody."	1
Elizabeth's	1
spirits	1
were	1
so	1
high	1
on	1
this	1
occasion,	1
that	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
often	1
speak	1
unnecessarily	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
asking	1
him	1
whether	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
accept	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
invitation,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
did,	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
think	1
it	1
proper	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
the	1
evening's	1
amusement;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
rather	1
surprised	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
he	1
entertained	1
no	1
scruple	1
whatever	1
on	1
that	1
head,	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
dreading	1
a	1
rebuke	1
either	1
from	1
the	1
Archbishop,	1
or	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh,	1
by	1
venturing	1
to	1
dance.	1
"I	1
am	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
of	1
the	1
opinion,	1
I	1
assure	1
you,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"that	1
a	1
ball	1
of	1
this	1
kind,	1
given	1
by	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
character,	1
to	1
respectable	1
people,	1
can	1
have	1
any	1
evil	1
tendency;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
objecting	1
to	1
dancing	1
myself,	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
hope	1
to	1
be	1
honoured	1
with	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
fair	1
cousins	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
evening;	1
and	1
I	1
take	1
this	1
opportunity	1
of	1
soliciting	1
yours,	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth,	1
for	1
the	1
two	1
first	1
dances	1
especially,	1
a	1
preference	1
which	1
I	1
trust	1
my	1
cousin	1
Jane	1
will	1
attribute	1
to	1
the	1
right	1
cause,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
any	1
disrespect	1
for	1
her."	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
herself	1
completely	1
taken	1
in.	1
She	1
had	1
fully	1
proposed	1
being	1
engaged	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
for	1
those	1
very	1
dances;	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
instead!	1
her	1
liveliness	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
worse	1
timed.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
help	1
for	1
it,	1
however.	1
Mr.	1
Wickham's	1
happiness	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
were	1
perforce	1
delayed	1
a	1
little	1
longer,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
proposal	1
accepted	1
with	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
grace	1
as	1
she	1
could.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
better	1
pleased	1
with	1
his	1
gallantry	1
from	1
the	1
idea	1
it	1
suggested	1
of	1
something	1
more.	1
It	1
now	1
first	1
struck	1
her,	1
that	1
_she_	1
was	1
selected	1
from	1
among	1
her	1
sisters	1
as	1
worthy	1
of	1
being	1
mistress	1
of	1
Hunsford	1
Parsonage,	1
and	1
of	1
assisting	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
quadrille	1
table	1
at	1
Rosings,	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
more	1
eligible	1
visitors.	1
The	1
idea	1
soon	1
reached	1
to	1
conviction,	1
as	1
she	1
observed	1
his	1
increasing	1
civilities	1
toward	1
herself,	1
and	1
heard	1
his	1
frequent	1
attempt	1
at	1
a	1
compliment	1
on	1
her	1
wit	1
and	1
vivacity;	1
and	1
though	1
more	1
astonished	1
than	1
gratified	1
herself	1
by	1
this	1
effect	1
of	1
her	1
charms,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
before	1
her	1
mother	1
gave	1
her	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
their	1
marriage	1
was	1
extremely	1
agreeable	1
to	1
_her_.	1
Elizabeth,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
choose	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
hint,	1
being	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
a	1
serious	1
dispute	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
consequence	1
of	1
any	1
reply.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
might	1
never	1
make	1
the	1
offer,	1
and	1
till	1
he	1
did,	1
it	1
was	1
useless	1
to	1
quarrel	1
about	1
him.	1
If	1
there	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
a	1
Netherfield	1
ball	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
and	1
talk	1
of,	1
the	1
younger	1
Miss	1
Bennets	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
pitiable	1
state	1
at	1
this	1
time,	1
for	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
invitation,	1
to	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
ball,	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
succession	1
of	1
rain	1
as	1
prevented	1
their	1
walking	1
to	1
Meryton	1
once.	1
No	1
aunt,	1
no	1
officers,	1
no	1
news	1
could	1
be	1
sought	1
after--the	1
very	1
shoe-roses	1
for	1
Netherfield	1
were	1
got	1
by	1
proxy.	1
Even	1
Elizabeth	1
might	1
have	1
found	1
some	1
trial	1
of	1
her	1
patience	1
in	1
weather	1
which	1
totally	1
suspended	1
the	1
improvement	1
of	1
her	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Wickham;	1
and	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
dance	1
on	1
Tuesday,	1
could	1
have	1
made	1
such	1
a	1
Friday,	1
Saturday,	1
Sunday,	1
and	1
Monday	1
endurable	1
to	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Lydia.	1
Chapter	1
18	1
Till	1
Elizabeth	1
entered	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
at	1
Netherfield,	1
and	1
looked	1
in	1
vain	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
among	1
the	1
cluster	1
of	1
red	1
coats	1
there	1
assembled,	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
present	1
had	1
never	1
occurred	1
to	1
her.	1
The	1
certainty	1
of	1
meeting	1
him	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
checked	1
by	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
recollections	1
that	1
might	1
not	1
unreasonably	1
have	1
alarmed	1
her.	1
She	1
had	1
dressed	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
usual	1
care,	1
and	1
prepared	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
spirits	1
for	1
the	1
conquest	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
remained	1
unsubdued	1
of	1
his	1
heart,	1
trusting	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
might	1
be	1
won	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
evening.	1
But	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
arose	1
the	1
dreadful	1
suspicion	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
purposely	1
omitted	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
Bingleys'	1
invitation	1
to	1
the	1
officers;	1
and	1
though	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
exactly	1
the	1
case,	1
the	1
absolute	1
fact	1
of	1
his	1
absence	1
was	1
pronounced	1
by	1
his	1
friend	1
Denny,	1
to	1
whom	1
Lydia	1
eagerly	1
applied,	1
and	1
who	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
Wickham	1
had	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
town	1
on	1
business	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
returned;	1
adding,	1
with	1
a	1
significant	1
smile,	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
imagine	1
his	1
business	1
would	1
have	1
called	1
him	1
away	1
just	1
now,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
wanted	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
certain	1
gentleman	1
here."	1
This	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
intelligence,	1
though	1
unheard	1
by	1
Lydia,	1
was	1
caught	1
by	1
Elizabeth,	1
and,	1
as	1
it	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
Darcy	1
was	1
not	1
less	1
answerable	1
for	1
Wickham's	1
absence	1
than	1
if	1
her	1
first	1
surmise	1
had	1
been	1
just,	1
every	1
feeling	1
of	1
displeasure	1
against	1
the	1
former	1
was	1
so	1
sharpened	1
by	1
immediate	1
disappointment,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
reply	1
with	1
tolerable	1
civility	1
to	1
the	1
polite	1
inquiries	1
which	1
he	1
directly	1
afterwards	1
approached	1
to	1
make.	1
Attendance,	1
forbearance,	1
patience	1
with	1
Darcy,	1
was	1
injury	1
to	1
Wickham.	1
She	1
was	1
resolved	1
against	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
conversation	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
ill-humour	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
wholly	1
surmount	1
even	1
in	1
speaking	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
whose	1
blind	1
partiality	1
provoked	1
her.	1
But	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
not	1
formed	1
for	1
ill-humour;	1
and	1
though	1
every	1
prospect	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
was	1
destroyed	1
for	1
the	1
evening,	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
dwell	1
long	1
on	1
her	1
spirits;	1
and	1
having	1
told	1
all	1
her	1
griefs	1
to	1
Charlotte	1
Lucas,	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
for	1
a	1
week,	1
she	1
was	1
soon	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
voluntary	1
transition	1
to	1
the	1
oddities	1
of	1
her	1
cousin,	1
and	1
to	1
point	1
him	1
out	1
to	1
her	1
particular	1
notice.	1
The	1
first	1
two	1
dances,	1
however,	1
brought	1
a	1
return	1
of	1
distress;	1
they	1
were	1
dances	1
of	1
mortification.	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
awkward	1
and	1
solemn,	1
apologising	1
instead	1
of	1
attending,	1
and	1
often	1
moving	1
wrong	1
without	1
being	1
aware	1
of	1
it,	1
gave	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
shame	1
and	1
misery	1
which	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
partner	1
for	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
dances	1
can	1
give.	1
The	1
moment	1
of	1
her	1
release	1
from	1
him	1
was	1
ecstasy.	1
She	1
danced	1
next	1
with	1
an	1
officer,	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
refreshment	1
of	1
talking	1
of	1
Wickham,	1
and	1
of	1
hearing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
universally	1
liked.	1
When	1
those	1
dances	1
were	1
over,	1
she	1
returned	1
to	1
Charlotte	1
Lucas,	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
her,	1
when	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
suddenly	1
addressed	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
who	1
took	1
her	1
so	1
much	1
by	1
surprise	1
in	1
his	1
application	1
for	1
her	1
hand,	1
that,	1
without	1
knowing	1
what	1
she	1
did,	1
she	1
accepted	1
him.	1
He	1
walked	1
away	1
again	1
immediately,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
fret	1
over	1
her	1
own	1
want	1
of	1
presence	1
of	1
mind;	1
Charlotte	1
tried	1
to	1
console	1
her:	1
"I	1
dare	1
say	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
him	1
very	1
agreeable."	1
"Heaven	1
forbid!	1
_That_	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
greatest	1
misfortune	1
of	1
all!	1
To	1
find	1
a	1
man	1
agreeable	1
whom	1
one	1
is	1
determined	1
to	1
hate!	1
Do	1
not	1
wish	1
me	1
such	1
an	1
evil."	1
When	1
the	1
dancing	1
recommenced,	1
however,	1
and	1
Darcy	1
approached	1
to	1
claim	1
her	1
hand,	1
Charlotte	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
cautioning	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
whisper,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
simpleton,	1
and	1
allow	1
her	1
fancy	1
for	1
Wickham	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
appear	1
unpleasant	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
ten	1
times	1
his	1
consequence.	1
Elizabeth	1
made	1
no	1
answer,	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
set,	1
amazed	1
at	1
the	1
dignity	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
arrived	1
in	1
being	1
allowed	1
to	1
stand	1
opposite	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
and	1
reading	1
in	1
her	1
neighbours'	1
looks,	1
their	1
equal	1
amazement	1
in	1
beholding	1
it.	1
They	1
stood	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
without	1
speaking	1
a	1
word;	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
their	1
silence	1
was	1
to	1
last	1
through	1
the	1
two	1
dances,	1
and	1
at	1
first	1
was	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
break	1
it;	1
till	1
suddenly	1
fancying	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
greater	1
punishment	1
to	1
her	1
partner	1
to	1
oblige	1
him	1
to	1
talk,	1
she	1
made	1
some	1
slight	1
observation	1
on	1
the	1
dance.	1
He	1
replied,	1
and	1
was	1
again	1
silent.	1
After	1
a	1
pause	1
of	1
some	1
minutes,	1
she	1
addressed	1
him	1
a	1
second	1
time	1
with:--"It	1
is	1
_your_	1
turn	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
now,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy.	1
I	1
talked	1
about	1
the	1
dance,	1
and	1
_you_	1
ought	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
sort	1
of	1
remark	1
on	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
or	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
couples."	1
He	1
smiled,	1
and	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
whatever	1
she	1
wished	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
should	1
be	1
said.	1
"Very	1
well.	1
That	1
reply	1
will	1
do	1
for	1
the	1
present.	1
Perhaps	1
by	1
and	1
by	1
I	1
may	1
observe	1
that	1
private	1
balls	1
are	1
much	1
pleasanter	1
than	1
public	1
ones.	1
But	1
_now_	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
silent."	1
"Do	1
you	1
talk	1
by	1
rule,	1
then,	1
while	1
you	1
are	1
dancing?"	1
"Sometimes.	1
One	1
must	1
speak	1
a	1
little,	1
you	1
know.	1
It	1
would	1
look	1
odd	1
to	1
be	1
entirely	1
silent	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
together;	1
and	1
yet	1
for	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
_some_,	1
conversation	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
arranged,	1
as	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
saying	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
possible."	1
"Are	1
you	1
consulting	1
your	1
own	1
feelings	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
case,	1
or	1
do	1
you	1
imagine	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
gratifying	1
mine?"	1
"Both,"	1
replied	1
Elizabeth	1
archly;	1
"for	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
seen	1
a	1
great	1
similarity	1
in	1
the	1
turn	1
of	1
our	1
minds.	1
We	1
are	1
each	1
of	1
an	1
unsocial,	1
taciturn	1
disposition,	1
unwilling	1
to	1
speak,	1
unless	1
we	1
expect	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
that	1
will	1
amaze	1
the	1
whole	1
room,	1
and	1
be	1
handed	1
down	1
to	1
posterity	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
eclat	1
of	1
a	1
proverb."	1
"This	1
is	1
no	1
very	1
striking	1
resemblance	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
character,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"How	1
near	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
to	1
_mine_,	1
I	1
cannot	1
pretend	1
to	1
say.	1
_You_	1
think	1
it	1
a	1
faithful	1
portrait	1
undoubtedly."	1
"I	1
must	1
not	1
decide	1
on	1
my	1
own	1
performance."	1
He	1
made	1
no	1
answer,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
again	1
silent	1
till	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
down	1
the	1
dance,	1
when	1
he	1
asked	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
sisters	1
did	1
not	1
very	1
often	1
walk	1
to	1
Meryton.	1
She	1
answered	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative,	1
and,	1
unable	1
to	1
resist	1
the	1
temptation,	1
added,	1
"When	1
you	1
met	1
us	1
there	1
the	1
other	1
day,	1
we	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
forming	1
a	1
new	1
acquaintance."	1
The	1
effect	1
was	1
immediate.	1
A	1
deeper	1
shade	1
of	1
_hauteur_	1
overspread	1
his	1
features,	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
not	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
Elizabeth,	1
though	1
blaming	1
herself	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
weakness,	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
on.	1
At	1
length	1
Darcy	1
spoke,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
constrained	1
manner	1
said,	1
"Mr.	1
Wickham	1
is	1
blessed	1
with	1
such	1
happy	1
manners	1
as	1
may	1
ensure	1
his	1
_making_	1
friends--whether	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
equally	1
capable	1
of	1
_retaining_	1
them,	1
is	1
less	1
certain."	1
"He	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
unlucky	1
as	1
to	1
lose	1
_your_	1
friendship,"	1
replied	1
Elizabeth	1
with	1
emphasis,	1
"and	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
suffer	1
from	1
all	1
his	1
life."	1
Darcy	1
made	1
no	1
answer,	1
and	1
seemed	1
desirous	1
of	1
changing	1
the	1
subject.	1
At	1
that	1
moment,	1
Sir	1
William	1
Lucas	1
appeared	1
close	1
to	1
them,	1
meaning	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
set	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
room;	1
but	1
on	1
perceiving	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
he	1
stopped	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
of	1
superior	1
courtesy	1
to	1
compliment	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
dancing	1
and	1
his	1
partner.	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
most	1
highly	1
gratified	1
indeed,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir.	1
Such	1
very	1
superior	1
dancing	1
is	1
not	1
often	1
seen.	1
It	1
is	1
evident	1
that	1
you	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
first	1
circles.	1
Allow	1
me	1
to	1
say,	1
however,	1
that	1
your	1
fair	1
partner	1
does	1
not	1
disgrace	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
hope	1
to	1
have	1
this	1
pleasure	1
often	1
repeated,	1
especially	1
when	1
a	1
certain	1
desirable	1
event,	1
my	1
dear	1
Eliza	1
(glancing	1
at	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
Bingley)	1
shall	1
take	1
place.	1
What	1
congratulations	1
will	1
then	1
flow	1
in!	1
I	1
appeal	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Darcy:--but	1
let	1
me	1
not	1
interrupt	1
you,	1
sir.	1
You	1
will	1
not	1
thank	1
me	1
for	1
detaining	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
bewitching	1
converse	1
of	1
that	1
young	1
lady,	1
whose	1
bright	1
eyes	1
are	1
also	1
upbraiding	1
me."	1
The	1
latter	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
address	1
was	1
scarcely	1
heard	1
by	1
Darcy;	1
but	1
Sir	1
William's	1
allusion	1
to	1
his	1
friend	1
seemed	1
to	1
strike	1
him	1
forcibly,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
directed	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
serious	1
expression	1
towards	1
Bingley	1
and	1
Jane,	1
who	1
were	1
dancing	1
together.	1
Recovering	1
himself,	1
however,	1
shortly,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
partner,	1
and	1
said,	1
"Sir	1
William's	1
interruption	1
has	1
made	1
me	1
forget	1
what	1
we	1
were	1
talking	1
of."	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
we	1
were	1
speaking	1
at	1
all.	1
Sir	1
William	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
interrupted	1
two	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
who	1
had	1
less	1
to	1
say	1
for	1
themselves.	1
We	1
have	1
tried	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
subjects	1
already	1
without	1
success,	1
and	1
what	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
next	1
I	1
cannot	1
imagine."	1
"What	1
think	1
you	1
of	1
books?"	1
said	1
he,	1
smiling.	1
"Books--oh!	1
no.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
we	1
never	1
read	1
the	1
same,	1
or	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
feelings."	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
you	1
think	1
so;	1
but	1
if	1
that	1
be	1
the	1
case,	1
there	1
can	1
at	1
least	1
be	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
subject.	1
We	1
may	1
compare	1
our	1
different	1
opinions."	1
"No--I	1
cannot	1
talk	1
of	1
books	1
in	1
a	1
ball-room;	1
my	1
head	1
is	1
always	1
full	1
of	1
something	1
else."	1
"The	1
_present_	1
always	1
occupies	1
you	1
in	1
such	1
scenes--does	1
it?"	1
said	1
he,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
doubt.	1
"Yes,	1
always,"	1
she	1
replied,	1
without	1
knowing	1
what	1
she	1
said,	1
for	1
her	1
thoughts	1
had	1
wandered	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
subject,	1
as	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
appeared	1
by	1
her	1
suddenly	1
exclaiming,	1
"I	1
remember	1
hearing	1
you	1
once	1
say,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
that	1
you	1
hardly	1
ever	1
forgave,	1
that	1
your	1
resentment	1
once	1
created	1
was	1
unappeasable.	1
You	1
are	1
very	1
cautious,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
as	1
to	1
its	1
_being	1
created_."	1
"I	1
am,"	1
said	1
he,	1
with	1
a	1
firm	1
voice.	1
"And	1
never	1
allow	1
yourself	1
to	1
be	1
blinded	1
by	1
prejudice?"	1
"I	1
hope	1
not."	1
"It	1
is	1
particularly	1
incumbent	1
on	1
those	1
who	1
never	1
change	1
their	1
opinion,	1
to	1
be	1
secure	1
of	1
judging	1
properly	1
at	1
first."	1
"May	1
I	1
ask	1
to	1
what	1
these	1
questions	1
tend?"	1
"Merely	1
to	1
the	1
illustration	1
of	1
_your_	1
character,"	1
said	1
she,	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
shake	1
off	1
her	1
gravity.	1
"I	1
am	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
out."	1
"And	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
success?"	1
She	1
shook	1
her	1
head.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
get	1
on	1
at	1
all.	1
I	1
hear	1
such	1
different	1
accounts	1
of	1
you	1
as	1
puzzle	1
me	1
exceedingly."	1
"I	1
can	1
readily	1
believe,"	1
answered	1
he	1
gravely,	1
"that	1
reports	1
may	1
vary	1
greatly	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
wish,	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
sketch	1
my	1
character	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
moment,	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
reason	1
to	1
fear	1
that	1
the	1
performance	1
would	1
reflect	1
no	1
credit	1
on	1
either."	1
"But	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
take	1
your	1
likeness	1
now,	1
I	1
may	1
never	1
have	1
another	1
opportunity."	1
"I	1
would	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
suspend	1
any	1
pleasure	1
of	1
yours,"	1
he	1
coldly	1
replied.	1
She	1
said	1
no	1
more,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
down	1
the	1
other	1
dance	1
and	1
parted	1
in	1
silence;	1
and	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
dissatisfied,	1
though	1
not	1
to	1
an	1
equal	1
degree,	1
for	1
in	1
Darcy's	1
breast	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
tolerable	1
powerful	1
feeling	1
towards	1
her,	1
which	1
soon	1
procured	1
her	1
pardon,	1
and	1
directed	1
all	1
his	1
anger	1
against	1
another.	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
long	1
separated,	1
when	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
came	1
towards	1
her,	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
civil	1
disdain	1
accosted	1
her:	1
"So,	1
Miss	1
Eliza,	1
I	1
hear	1
you	1
are	1
quite	1
delighted	1
with	1
George	1
Wickham!	1
Your	1
sister	1
has	1
been	1
talking	1
to	1
me	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
asking	1
me	1
a	1
thousand	1
questions;	1
and	1
I	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
quite	1
forgot	1
to	1
tell	1
you,	1
among	1
his	1
other	1
communication,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
old	1
Wickham,	1
the	1
late	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
steward.	1
Let	1
me	1
recommend	1
you,	1
however,	1
as	1
a	1
friend,	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
implicit	1
confidence	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
assertions;	1
for	1
as	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
using	1
him	1
ill,	1
it	1
is	1
perfectly	1
false;	1
for,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
has	1
always	1
been	1
remarkably	1
kind	1
to	1
him,	1
though	1
George	1
Wickham	1
has	1
treated	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
infamous	1
manner.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
particulars,	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
to	1
blame,	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
bear	1
to	1
hear	1
George	1
Wickham	1
mentioned,	1
and	1
that	1
though	1
my	1
brother	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
well	1
avoid	1
including	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
invitation	1
to	1
the	1
officers,	1
he	1
was	1
excessively	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
himself	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way.	1
His	1
coming	1
into	1
the	1
country	1
at	1
all	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
insolent	1
thing,	1
indeed,	1
and	1
I	1
wonder	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
presume	1
to	1
do	1
it.	1
I	1
pity	1
you,	1
Miss	1
Eliza,	1
for	1
this	1
discovery	1
of	1
your	1
favourite's	1
guilt;	1
but	1
really,	1
considering	1
his	1
descent,	1
one	1
could	1
not	1
expect	1
much	1
better."	1
"His	1
guilt	1
and	1
his	1
descent	1
appear	1
by	1
your	1
account	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
same,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
angrily;	1
"for	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
you	1
accuse	1
him	1
of	1
nothing	1
worse	1
than	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
steward,	1
and	1
of	1
_that_,	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
you,	1
he	1
informed	1
me	1
himself."	1
"I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,"	1
replied	1
Miss	1
Bingley,	1
turning	1
away	1
with	1
a	1
sneer.	1
"Excuse	1
my	1
interference--it	1
was	1
kindly	1
meant."	1
"Insolent	1
girl!"	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
to	1
herself.	1
"You	1
are	1
much	1
mistaken	1
if	1
you	1
expect	1
to	1
influence	1
me	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
paltry	1
attack	1
as	1
this.	1
I	1
see	1
nothing	1
in	1
it	1
but	1
your	1
own	1
wilful	1
ignorance	1
and	1
the	1
malice	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy."	1
She	1
then	1
sought	1
her	1
eldest	1
sister,	1
who	1
has	1
undertaken	1
to	1
make	1
inquiries	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
subject	1
of	1
Bingley.	1
Jane	1
met	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
such	1
sweet	1
complacency,	1
a	1
glow	1
of	1
such	1
happy	1
expression,	1
as	1
sufficiently	1
marked	1
how	1
well	1
she	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
occurrences	1
of	1
the	1
evening.	1
Elizabeth	1
instantly	1
read	1
her	1
feelings,	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
solicitude	1
for	1
Wickham,	1
resentment	1
against	1
his	1
enemies,	1
and	1
everything	1
else,	1
gave	1
way	1
before	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
Jane's	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
fairest	1
way	1
for	1
happiness.	1
"I	1
want	1
to	1
know,"	1
said	1
she,	1
with	1
a	1
countenance	1
no	1
less	1
smiling	1
than	1
her	1
sister's,	1
"what	1
you	1
have	1
learnt	1
about	1
Mr.	1
Wickham.	1
But	1
perhaps	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
too	1
pleasantly	1
engaged	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
any	1
third	1
person;	1
in	1
which	1
case	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
sure	1
of	1
my	1
pardon."	1
"No,"	1
replied	1
Jane,	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
forgotten	1
him;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
satisfactory	1
to	1
tell	1
you.	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
history,	1
and	1
is	1
quite	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
circumstances	1
which	1
have	1
principally	1
offended	1
Mr.	1
Darcy;	1
but	1
he	1
will	1
vouch	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
conduct,	1
the	1
probity,	1
and	1
honour	1
of	1
his	1
friend,	1
and	1
is	1
perfectly	1
convinced	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
has	1
deserved	1
much	1
less	1
attention	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
than	1
he	1
has	1
received;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
say	1
by	1
his	1
account	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
his	1
sister's,	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
a	1
respectable	1
young	1
man.	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
imprudent,	1
and	1
has	1
deserved	1
to	1
lose	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
regard."	1
"Mr.	1
Bingley	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
himself?"	1
"No;	1
he	1
never	1
saw	1
him	1
till	1
the	1
other	1
morning	1
at	1
Meryton."	1
"This	1
account	1
then	1
is	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
received	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Darcy.	1
I	1
am	1
satisfied.	1
But	1
what	1
does	1
he	1
say	1
of	1
the	1
living?"	1
"He	1
does	1
not	1
exactly	1
recollect	1
the	1
circumstances,	1
though	1
he	1
has	1
heard	1
them	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
more	1
than	1
once,	1
but	1
he	1
believes	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
him	1
_conditionally_	1
only."	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
sincerity,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
warmly;	1
"but	1
you	1
must	1
excuse	1
my	1
not	1
being	1
convinced	1
by	1
assurances	1
only.	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
defense	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
able	1
one,	1
I	1
dare	1
say;	1
but	1
since	1
he	1
is	1
unacquainted	1
with	1
several	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
story,	1
and	1
has	1
learnt	1
the	1
rest	1
from	1
that	1
friend	1
himself,	1
I	1
shall	1
venture	1
to	1
still	1
think	1
of	1
both	1
gentlemen	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
before."	1
She	1
then	1
changed	1
the	1
discourse	1
to	1
one	1
more	1
gratifying	1
to	1
each,	1
and	1
on	1
which	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
difference	1
of	1
sentiment.	1
Elizabeth	1
listened	1
with	1
delight	1
to	1
the	1
happy,	1
though	1
modest	1
hopes	1
which	1
Jane	1
entertained	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
regard,	1
and	1
said	1
all	1
in	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
heighten	1
her	1
confidence	1
in	1
it.	1
On	1
their	1
being	1
joined	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
himself,	1
Elizabeth	1
withdrew	1
to	1
Miss	1
Lucas;	1
to	1
whose	1
inquiry	1
after	1
the	1
pleasantness	1
of	1
her	1
last	1
partner	1
she	1
had	1
scarcely	1
replied,	1
before	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
with	1
great	1
exultation	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
so	1
fortunate	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
most	1
important	1
discovery.	1
"I	1
have	1
found	1
out,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"by	1
a	1
singular	1
accident,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
a	1
near	1
relation	1
of	1
my	1
patroness.	1
I	1
happened	1
to	1
overhear	1
the	1
gentleman	1
himself	1
mentioning	1
to	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
who	1
does	1
the	1
honours	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
his	1
cousin	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh,	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
Lady	1
Catherine.	1
How	1
wonderfully	1
these	1
sort	1
of	1
things	1
occur!	1
Who	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
of	1
my	1
meeting	1
with,	1
perhaps,	1
a	1
nephew	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
in	1
this	1
assembly!	1
I	1
am	1
most	1
thankful	1
that	1
the	1
discovery	1
is	1
made	1
in	1
time	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
pay	1
my	1
respects	1
to	1
him,	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
trust	1
he	1
will	1
excuse	1
my	1
not	1
having	1
done	1
it	1
before.	1
My	1
total	1
ignorance	1
of	1
the	1
connection	1
must	1
plead	1
my	1
apology."	1
"You	1
are	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
introduce	1
yourself	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Darcy!"	1
"Indeed	1
I	1
am.	1
I	1
shall	1
entreat	1
his	1
pardon	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
done	1
it	1
earlier.	1
I	1
believe	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
Lady	1
Catherine's	1
_nephew_.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
assure	1
him	1
that	1
her	1
ladyship	1
was	1
quite	1
well	1
yesterday	1
se'nnight."	1
Elizabeth	1
tried	1
hard	1
to	1
dissuade	1
him	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
scheme,	1
assuring	1
him	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
would	1
consider	1
his	1
addressing	1
him	1
without	1
introduction	1
as	1
an	1
impertinent	1
freedom,	1
rather	1
than	1
a	1
compliment	1
to	1
his	1
aunt;	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
necessary	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
any	1
notice	1
on	1
either	1
side;	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
were,	1
it	1
must	1
belong	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
the	1
superior	1
in	1
consequence,	1
to	1
begin	1
the	1
acquaintance.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
determined	1
air	1
of	1
following	1
his	1
own	1
inclination,	1
and,	1
when	1
she	1
ceased	1
speaking,	1
replied	1
thus:	1
"My	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth,	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
highest	1
opinion	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
your	1
excellent	1
judgement	1
in	1
all	1
matters	1
within	1
the	1
scope	1
of	1
your	1
understanding;	1
but	1
permit	1
me	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
wide	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
established	1
forms	1
of	1
ceremony	1
amongst	1
the	1
laity,	1
and	1
those	1
which	1
regulate	1
the	1
clergy;	1
for,	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
I	1
consider	1
the	1
clerical	1
office	1
as	1
equal	1
in	1
point	1
of	1
dignity	1
with	1
the	1
highest	1
rank	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom--provided	1
that	1
a	1
proper	1
humility	1
of	1
behaviour	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
maintained.	1
You	1
must	1
therefore	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
dictates	1
of	1
my	1
conscience	1
on	1
this	1
occasion,	1
which	1
leads	1
me	1
to	1
perform	1
what	1
I	1
look	1
on	1
as	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
duty.	1
Pardon	1
me	1
for	1
neglecting	1
to	1
profit	1
by	1
your	1
advice,	1
which	1
on	1
every	1
other	1
subject	1
shall	1
be	1
my	1
constant	1
guide,	1
though	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
before	1
us	1
I	1
consider	1
myself	1
more	1
fitted	1
by	1
education	1
and	1
habitual	1
study	1
to	1
decide	1
on	1
what	1
is	1
right	1
than	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
like	1
yourself."	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
low	1
bow	1
he	1
left	1
her	1
to	1
attack	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
whose	1
reception	1
of	1
his	1
advances	1
she	1
eagerly	1
watched,	1
and	1
whose	1
astonishment	1
at	1
being	1
so	1
addressed	1
was	1
very	1
evident.	1
Her	1
cousin	1
prefaced	1
his	1
speech	1
with	1
a	1
solemn	1
bow	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
it,	1
she	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
hearing	1
it	1
all,	1
and	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
his	1
lips	1
the	1
words	1
"apology,"	1
"Hunsford,"	1
and	1
"Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh."	1
It	1
vexed	1
her	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
expose	1
himself	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
man.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
was	1
eyeing	1
him	1
with	1
unrestrained	1
wonder,	1
and	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
allowed	1
him	1
time	1
to	1
speak,	1
replied	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
distant	1
civility.	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
however,	1
was	1
not	1
discouraged	1
from	1
speaking	1
again,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
contempt	1
seemed	1
abundantly	1
increasing	1
with	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
his	1
second	1
speech,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
only	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
slight	1
bow,	1
and	1
moved	1
another	1
way.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
then	1
returned	1
to	1
Elizabeth.	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
reason,	1
I	1
assure	1
you,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"to	1
be	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
my	1
reception.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
seemed	1
much	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
attention.	1
He	1
answered	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
civility,	1
and	1
even	1
paid	1
me	1
the	1
compliment	1
of	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
well	1
convinced	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine's	1
discernment	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
certain	1
she	1
could	1
never	1
bestow	1
a	1
favour	1
unworthily.	1
It	1
was	1
really	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
thought.	1
Upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
pleased	1
with	1
him."	1
As	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
no	1
longer	1
any	1
interest	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
to	1
pursue,	1
she	1
turned	1
her	1
attention	1
almost	1
entirely	1
on	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Bingley;	1
and	1
the	1
train	1
of	1
agreeable	1
reflections	1
which	1
her	1
observations	1
gave	1
birth	1
to,	1
made	1
her	1
perhaps	1
almost	1
as	1
happy	1
as	1
Jane.	1
She	1
saw	1
her	1
in	1
idea	1
settled	1
in	1
that	1
very	1
house,	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
felicity	1
which	1
a	1
marriage	1
of	1
true	1
affection	1
could	1
bestow;	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
capable,	1
under	1
such	1
circumstances,	1
of	1
endeavouring	1
even	1
to	1
like	1
Bingley's	1
two	1
sisters.	1
Her	1
mother's	1
thoughts	1
she	1
plainly	1
saw	1
were	1
bent	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
and	1
she	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
venture	1
near	1
her,	1
lest	1
she	1
might	1
hear	1
too	1
much.	1
When	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
supper,	1
therefore,	1
she	1
considered	1
it	1
a	1
most	1
unlucky	1
perverseness	1
which	1
placed	1
them	1
within	1
one	1
of	1
each	1
other;	1
and	1
deeply	1
was	1
she	1
vexed	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
that	1
one	1
person	1
(Lady	1
Lucas)	1
freely,	1
openly,	1
and	1
of	1
nothing	1
else	1
but	1
her	1
expectation	1
that	1
Jane	1
would	1
soon	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Bingley.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
animating	1
subject,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
seemed	1
incapable	1
of	1
fatigue	1
while	1
enumerating	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
the	1
match.	1
His	1
being	1
such	1
a	1
charming	1
young	1
man,	1
and	1
so	1
rich,	1
and	1
living	1
but	1
three	1
miles	1
from	1
them,	1
were	1
the	1
first	1
points	1
of	1
self-gratulation;	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
comfort	1
to	1
think	1
how	1
fond	1
the	1
two	1
sisters	1
were	1
of	1
Jane,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
certain	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
desire	1
the	1
connection	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
do.	1
It	1
was,	1
moreover,	1
such	1
a	1
promising	1
thing	1
for	1
her	1
younger	1
daughters,	1
as	1
Jane's	1
marrying	1
so	1
greatly	1
must	1
throw	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
other	1
rich	1
men;	1
and	1
lastly,	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
pleasant	1
at	1
her	1
time	1
of	1
life	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
consign	1
her	1
single	1
daughters	1
to	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
their	1
sister,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
company	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
liked.	1
It	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
make	1
this	1
circumstance	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
pleasure,	1
because	1
on	1
such	1
occasions	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
etiquette;	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
less	1
likely	1
than	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
to	1
find	1
comfort	1
in	1
staying	1
home	1
at	1
any	1
period	1
of	1
her	1
life.	1
She	1
concluded	1
with	1
many	1
good	1
wishes	1
that	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
might	1
soon	1
be	1
equally	1
fortunate,	1
though	1
evidently	1
and	1
triumphantly	1
believing	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
it.	1
In	1
vain	1
did	1
Elizabeth	1
endeavour	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
rapidity	1
of	1
her	1
mother's	1
words,	1
or	1
persuade	1
her	1
to	1
describe	1
her	1
felicity	1
in	1
a	1
less	1
audible	1
whisper;	1
for,	1
to	1
her	1
inexpressible	1
vexation,	1
she	1
could	1
perceive	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
overheard	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
who	1
sat	1
opposite	1
to	1
them.	1
Her	1
mother	1
only	1
scolded	1
her	1
for	1
being	1
nonsensical.	1
"What	1
is	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
to	1
me,	1
pray,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
him?	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
we	1
owe	1
him	1
no	1
such	1
particular	1
civility	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
say	1
nothing	1
_he_	1
may	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
hear."	1
"For	1
heaven's	1
sake,	1
madam,	1
speak	1
lower.	1
What	1
advantage	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
offend	1
Mr.	1
Darcy?	1
You	1
will	1
never	1
recommend	1
yourself	1
to	1
his	1
friend	1
by	1
so	1
doing!"	1
Nothing	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
say,	1
however,	1
had	1
any	1
influence.	1
Her	1
mother	1
would	1
talk	1
of	1
her	1
views	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
intelligible	1
tone.	1
Elizabeth	1
blushed	1
and	1
blushed	1
again	1
with	1
shame	1
and	1
vexation.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
frequently	1
glancing	1
her	1
eye	1
at	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
though	1
every	1
glance	1
convinced	1
her	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
dreaded;	1
for	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
always	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
mother,	1
she	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
his	1
attention	1
was	1
invariably	1
fixed	1
by	1
her.	1
The	1
expression	1
of	1
his	1
face	1
changed	1
gradually	1
from	1
indignant	1
contempt	1
to	1
a	1
composed	1
and	1
steady	1
gravity.	1
At	1
length,	1
however,	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
say;	1
and	1
Lady	1
Lucas,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
long	1
yawning	1
at	1
the	1
repetition	1
of	1
delights	1
which	1
she	1
saw	1
no	1
likelihood	1
of	1
sharing,	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
comforts	1
of	1
cold	1
ham	1
and	1
chicken.	1
Elizabeth	1
now	1
began	1
to	1
revive.	1
But	1
not	1
long	1
was	1
the	1
interval	1
of	1
tranquillity;	1
for,	1
when	1
supper	1
was	1
over,	1
singing	1
was	1
talked	1
of,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
mortification	1
of	1
seeing	1
Mary,	1
after	1
very	1
little	1
entreaty,	1
preparing	1
to	1
oblige	1
the	1
company.	1
By	1
many	1
significant	1
looks	1
and	1
silent	1
entreaties,	1
did	1
she	1
endeavour	1
to	1
prevent	1
such	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
complaisance,	1
but	1
in	1
vain;	1
Mary	1
would	1
not	1
understand	1
them;	1
such	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
exhibiting	1
was	1
delightful	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
began	1
her	1
song.	1
Elizabeth's	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
with	1
most	1
painful	1
sensations,	1
and	1
she	1
watched	1
her	1
progress	1
through	1
the	1
several	1
stanzas	1
with	1
an	1
impatience	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
ill	1
rewarded	1
at	1
their	1
close;	1
for	1
Mary,	1
on	1
receiving,	1
amongst	1
the	1
thanks	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
the	1
hint	1
of	1
a	1
hope	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
favour	1
them	1
again,	1
after	1
the	1
pause	1
of	1
half	1
a	1
minute	1
began	1
another.	1
Mary's	1
powers	1
were	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
fitted	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
display;	1
her	1
voice	1
was	1
weak,	1
and	1
her	1
manner	1
affected.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
in	1
agonies.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
Jane,	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
she	1
bore	1
it;	1
but	1
Jane	1
was	1
very	1
composedly	1
talking	1
to	1
Bingley.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
two	1
sisters,	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
making	1
signs	1
of	1
derision	1
at	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
at	1
Darcy,	1
who	1
continued,	1
however,	1
imperturbably	1
grave.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
entreat	1
his	1
interference,	1
lest	1
Mary	1
should	1
be	1
singing	1
all	1
night.	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
hint,	1
and	1
when	1
Mary	1
had	1
finished	1
her	1
second	1
song,	1
said	1
aloud,	1
"That	1
will	1
do	1
extremely	1
well,	1
child.	1
You	1
have	1
delighted	1
us	1
long	1
enough.	1
Let	1
the	1
other	1
young	1
ladies	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
exhibit."	1
Mary,	1
though	1
pretending	1
not	1
to	1
hear,	1
was	1
somewhat	1
disconcerted;	1
and	1
Elizabeth,	1
sorry	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
sorry	1
for	1
her	1
father's	1
speech,	1
was	1
afraid	1
her	1
anxiety	1
had	1
done	1
no	1
good.	1
Others	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
were	1
now	1
applied	1
to.	1
"If	1
I,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
"were	1
so	1
fortunate	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
sing,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
great	1
pleasure,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
in	1
obliging	1
the	1
company	1
with	1
an	1
air;	1
for	1
I	1
consider	1
music	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
innocent	1
diversion,	1
and	1
perfectly	1
compatible	1
with	1
the	1
profession	1
of	1
a	1
clergyman.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean,	1
however,	1
to	1
assert	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
be	1
justified	1
in	1
devoting	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
our	1
time	1
to	1
music,	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
certainly	1
other	1
things	1
to	1
be	1
attended	1
to.	1
The	1
rector	1
of	1
a	1
parish	1
has	1
much	1
to	1
do.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
he	1
must	1
make	1
such	1
an	1
agreement	1
for	1
tithes	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
beneficial	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
not	1
offensive	1
to	1
his	1
patron.	1
He	1
must	1
write	1
his	1
own	1
sermons;	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
remains	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
his	1
parish	1
duties,	1
and	1
the	1
care	1
and	1
improvement	1
of	1
his	1
dwelling,	1
which	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
excused	1
from	1
making	1
as	1
comfortable	1
as	1
possible.	1
And	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
of	1
light	1
importance	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
attentive	1
and	1
conciliatory	1
manners	1
towards	1
everybody,	1
especially	1
towards	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
owes	1
his	1
preferment.	1
I	1
cannot	1
acquit	1
him	1
of	1
that	1
duty;	1
nor	1
could	1
I	1
think	1
well	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
should	1
omit	1
an	1
occasion	1
of	1
testifying	1
his	1
respect	1
towards	1
anybody	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
family."	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
bow	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
he	1
concluded	1
his	1
speech,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
so	1
loud	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
by	1
half	1
the	1
room.	1
Many	1
stared--many	1
smiled;	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
looked	1
more	1
amused	1
than	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
himself,	1
while	1
his	1
wife	1
seriously	1
commended	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
for	1
having	1
spoken	1
so	1
sensibly,	1
and	1
observed	1
in	1
a	1
half-whisper	1
to	1
Lady	1
Lucas,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
remarkably	1
clever,	1
good	1
kind	1
of	1
young	1
man.	1
To	1
Elizabeth	1
it	1
appeared	1
that,	1
had	1
her	1
family	1
made	1
an	1
agreement	1
to	1
expose	1
themselves	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
during	1
the	1
evening,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
impossible	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
play	1
their	1
parts	1
with	1
more	1
spirit	1
or	1
finer	1
success;	1
and	1
happy	1
did	1
she	1
think	1
it	1
for	1
Bingley	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
exhibition	1
had	1
escaped	1
his	1
notice,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
feelings	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
distressed	1
by	1
the	1
folly	1
which	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
witnessed.	1
That	1
his	1
two	1
sisters	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
however,	1
should	1
have	1
such	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
ridiculing	1
her	1
relations,	1
was	1
bad	1
enough,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
determine	1
whether	1
the	1
silent	1
contempt	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
or	1
the	1
insolent	1
smiles	1
of	1
the	1
ladies,	1
were	1
more	1
intolerable.	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
brought	1
her	1
little	1
amusement.	1
She	1
was	1
teased	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
who	1
continued	1
most	1
perseveringly	1
by	1
her	1
side,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
prevail	1
on	1
her	1
to	1
dance	1
with	1
him	1
again,	1
put	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
dance	1
with	1
others.	1
In	1
vain	1
did	1
she	1
entreat	1
him	1
to	1
stand	1
up	1
with	1
somebody	1
else,	1
and	1
offer	1
to	1
introduce	1
him	1
to	1
any	1
young	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
He	1
assured	1
her,	1
that	1
as	1
to	1
dancing,	1
he	1
was	1
perfectly	1
indifferent	1
to	1
it;	1
that	1
his	1
chief	1
object	1
was	1
by	1
delicate	1
attentions	1
to	1
recommend	1
himself	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
therefore	1
make	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
remaining	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
whole	1
evening.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
arguing	1
upon	1
such	1
a	1
project.	1
She	1
owed	1
her	1
greatest	1
relief	1
to	1
her	1
friend	1
Miss	1
Lucas,	1
who	1
often	1
joined	1
them,	1
and	1
good-naturedly	1
engaged	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
conversation	1
to	1
herself.	1
She	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
free	1
from	1
the	1
offense	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
further	1
notice;	1
though	1
often	1
standing	1
within	1
a	1
very	1
short	1
distance	1
of	1
her,	1
quite	1
disengaged,	1
he	1
never	1
came	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
speak.	1
She	1
felt	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
probable	1
consequence	1
of	1
her	1
allusions	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Wickham,	1
and	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
it.	1
The	1
Longbourn	1
party	1
were	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
company	1
to	1
depart,	1
and,	1
by	1
a	1
manoeuvre	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
had	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
their	1
carriage	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
after	1
everybody	1
else	1
was	1
gone,	1
which	1
gave	1
them	1
time	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
heartily	1
they	1
were	1
wished	1
away	1
by	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
family.	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
scarcely	1
opened	1
their	1
mouths,	1
except	1
to	1
complain	1
of	1
fatigue,	1
and	1
were	1
evidently	1
impatient	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
themselves.	1
They	1
repulsed	1
every	1
attempt	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
at	1
conversation,	1
and	1
by	1
so	1
doing	1
threw	1
a	1
languor	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
party,	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
little	1
relieved	1
by	1
the	1
long	1
speeches	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
who	1
was	1
complimenting	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
and	1
his	1
sisters	1
on	1
the	1
elegance	1
of	1
their	1
entertainment,	1
and	1
the	1
hospitality	1
and	1
politeness	1
which	1
had	1
marked	1
their	1
behaviour	1
to	1
their	1
guests.	1
Darcy	1
said	1
nothing	1
at	1
all.	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
in	1
equal	1
silence,	1
was	1
enjoying	1
the	1
scene.	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
and	1
Jane	1
were	1
standing	1
together,	1
a	1
little	1
detached	1
from	1
the	1
rest,	1
and	1
talked	1
only	1
to	1
each	1
other.	1
Elizabeth	1
preserved	1
as	1
steady	1
a	1
silence	1
as	1
either	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst	1
or	1
Miss	1
Bingley;	1
and	1
even	1
Lydia	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
fatigued	1
to	1
utter	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
occasional	1
exclamation	1
of	1
"Lord,	1
how	1
tired	1
I	1
am!"	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
violent	1
yawn.	1
When	1
at	1
length	1
they	1
arose	1
to	1
take	1
leave,	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
most	1
pressingly	1
civil	1
in	1
her	1
hope	1
of	1
seeing	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
soon	1
at	1
Longbourn,	1
and	1
addressed	1
herself	1
especially	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
to	1
assure	1
him	1
how	1
happy	1
he	1
would	1
make	1
them	1
by	1
eating	1
a	1
family	1
dinner	1
with	1
them	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
without	1
the	1
ceremony	1
of	1
a	1
formal	1
invitation.	1
Bingley	1
was	1
all	1
grateful	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
he	1
readily	1
engaged	1
for	1
taking	1
the	1
earliest	1
opportunity	1
of	1
waiting	1
on	1
her,	1
after	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
London,	1
whither	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
go	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
perfectly	1
satisfied,	1
and	1
quitted	1
the	1
house	1
under	1
the	1
delightful	1
persuasion	1
that,	1
allowing	1
for	1
the	1
necessary	1
preparations	1
of	1
settlements,	1
new	1
carriages,	1
and	1
wedding	1
clothes,	1
she	1
should	1
undoubtedly	1
see	1
her	1
daughter	1
settled	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
months.	1
Of	1
having	1
another	1
daughter	1
married	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
she	1
thought	1
with	1
equal	1
certainty,	1
and	1
with	1
considerable,	1
though	1
not	1
equal,	1
pleasure.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
the	1
least	1
dear	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
children;	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
match	1
were	1
quite	1
good	1
enough	1
for	1
_her_,	1
the	1
worth	1
of	1
each	1
was	1
eclipsed	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
and	1
Netherfield.	1
Chapter	1
19	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
opened	1
a	1
new	1
scene	1
at	1
Longbourn.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
made	1
his	1
declaration	1
in	1
form.	1
Having	1
resolved	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
without	1
loss	1
of	1
time,	1
as	1
his	1
leave	1
of	1
absence	1
extended	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
following	1
Saturday,	1
and	1
having	1
no	1
feelings	1
of	1
diffidence	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
distressing	1
to	1
himself	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
moment,	1
he	1
set	1
about	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
orderly	1
manner,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
observances,	1
which	1
he	1
supposed	1
a	1
regular	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
business.	1
On	1
finding	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
Elizabeth,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
girls	1
together,	1
soon	1
after	1
breakfast,	1
he	1
addressed	1
the	1
mother	1
in	1
these	1
words:	1
"May	1
I	1
hope,	1
madam,	1
for	1
your	1
interest	1
with	1
your	1
fair	1
daughter	1
Elizabeth,	1
when	1
I	1
solicit	1
for	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
a	1
private	1
audience	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
this	1
morning?"	1
Before	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
time	1
for	1
anything	1
but	1
a	1
blush	1
of	1
surprise,	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
answered	1
instantly,	1
"Oh	1
dear!--yes--certainly.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
Lizzy	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
happy--I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
objection.	1
Come,	1
Kitty,	1
I	1
want	1
you	1
up	1
stairs."	1
And,	1
gathering	1
her	1
work	1
together,	1
she	1
was	1
hastening	1
away,	1
when	1
Elizabeth	1
called	1
out:	1
"Dear	1
madam,	1
do	1
not	1
go.	1
I	1
beg	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
go.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
must	1
excuse	1
me.	1
He	1
can	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
anybody	1
need	1
not	1
hear.	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
away	1
myself."	1
"No,	1
no,	1
nonsense,	1
Lizzy.	1
I	1
desire	1
you	1
to	1
stay	1
where	1
you	1
are."	1
And	1
upon	1
Elizabeth's	1
seeming	1
really,	1
with	1
vexed	1
and	1
embarrassed	1
looks,	1
about	1
to	1
escape,	1
she	1
added:	1
"Lizzy,	1
I	1
_insist_	1
upon	1
your	1
staying	1
and	1
hearing	1
Mr.	1
Collins."	1
Elizabeth	1
would	1
not	1
oppose	1
such	1
an	1
injunction--and	1
a	1
moment's	1
consideration	1
making	1
her	1
also	1
sensible	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
wisest	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
over	1
as	1
soon	1
and	1
as	1
quietly	1
as	1
possible,	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
conceal,	1
by	1
incessant	1
employment	1
the	1
feelings	1
which	1
were	1
divided	1
between	1
distress	1
and	1
diversion.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
and	1
Kitty	1
walked	1
off,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
gone,	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
began.	1
"Believe	1
me,	1
my	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth,	1
that	1
your	1
modesty,	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
doing	1
you	1
any	1
disservice,	1
rather	1
adds	1
to	1
your	1
other	1
perfections.	1
You	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
less	1
amiable	1
in	1
my	1
eyes	1
had	1
there	1
_not_	1
been	1
this	1
little	1
unwillingness;	1
but	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
assure	1
you,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
your	1
respected	1
mother's	1
permission	1
for	1
this	1
address.	1
You	1
can	1
hardly	1
doubt	1
the	1
purport	1
of	1
my	1
discourse,	1
however	1
your	1
natural	1
delicacy	1
may	1
lead	1
you	1
to	1
dissemble;	1
my	1
attentions	1
have	1
been	1
too	1
marked	1
to	1
be	1
mistaken.	1
Almost	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
entered	1
the	1
house,	1
I	1
singled	1
you	1
out	1
as	1
the	1
companion	1
of	1
my	1
future	1
life.	1
But	1
before	1
I	1
am	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
by	1
my	1
feelings	1
on	1
this	1
subject,	1
perhaps	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
advisable	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
state	1
my	1
reasons	1
for	1
marrying--and,	1
moreover,	1
for	1
coming	1
into	1
Hertfordshire	1
with	1
the	1
design	1
of	1
selecting	1
a	1
wife,	1
as	1
I	1
certainly	1
did."	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
solemn	1
composure,	1
being	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
by	1
his	1
feelings,	1
made	1
Elizabeth	1
so	1
near	1
laughing,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
use	1
the	1
short	1
pause	1
he	1
allowed	1
in	1
any	1
attempt	1
to	1
stop	1
him	1
further,	1
and	1
he	1
continued:	1
"My	1
reasons	1
for	1
marrying	1
are,	1
first,	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
a	1
right	1
thing	1
for	1
every	1
clergyman	1
in	1
easy	1
circumstances	1
(like	1
myself)	1
to	1
set	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
matrimony	1
in	1
his	1
parish;	1
secondly,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
add	1
very	1
greatly	1
to	1
my	1
happiness;	1
and	1
thirdly--which	1
perhaps	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
mentioned	1
earlier,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
particular	1
advice	1
and	1
recommendation	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
noble	1
lady	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
calling	1
patroness.	1
Twice	1
has	1
she	1
condescended	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
her	1
opinion	1
(unasked	1
too!)	1
on	1
this	1
subject;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
the	1
very	1
Saturday	1
night	1
before	1
I	1
left	1
Hunsford--between	1
our	1
pools	1
at	1
quadrille,	1
while	1
Mrs.	1
Jenkinson	1
was	1
arranging	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh's	1
footstool,	1
that	1
she	1
said,	1
'Mr.	1
Collins,	1
you	1
must	1
marry.	1
A	1
clergyman	1
like	1
you	1
must	1
marry.	1
Choose	1
properly,	1
choose	1
a	1
gentlewoman	1
for	1
_my_	1
sake;	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
_own_,	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
an	1
active,	1
useful	1
sort	1
of	1
person,	1
not	1
brought	1
up	1
high,	1
but	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
small	1
income	1
go	1
a	1
good	1
way.	1
This	1
is	1
my	1
advice.	1
Find	1
such	1
a	1
woman	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
can,	1
bring	1
her	1
to	1
Hunsford,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
visit	1
her.'	1
Allow	1
me,	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
to	1
observe,	1
my	1
fair	1
cousin,	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
reckon	1
the	1
notice	1
and	1
kindness	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
as	1
among	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
advantages	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
offer.	1
You	1
will	1
find	1
her	1
manners	1
beyond	1
anything	1
I	1
can	1
describe;	1
and	1
your	1
wit	1
and	1
vivacity,	1
I	1
think,	1
must	1
be	1
acceptable	1
to	1
her,	1
especially	1
when	1
tempered	1
with	1
the	1
silence	1
and	1
respect	1
which	1
her	1
rank	1
will	1
inevitably	1
excite.	1
Thus	1
much	1
for	1
my	1
general	1
intention	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
matrimony;	1
it	1
remains	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
why	1
my	1
views	1
were	1
directed	1
towards	1
Longbourn	1
instead	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
neighbourhood,	1
where	1
I	1
can	1
assure	1
you	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
amiable	1
young	1
women.	1
But	1
the	1
fact	1
is,	1
that	1
being,	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
to	1
inherit	1
this	1
estate	1
after	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
your	1
honoured	1
father	1
(who,	1
however,	1
may	1
live	1
many	1
years	1
longer),	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
satisfy	1
myself	1
without	1
resolving	1
to	1
choose	1
a	1
wife	1
from	1
among	1
his	1
daughters,	1
that	1
the	1
loss	1
to	1
them	1
might	1
be	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
possible,	1
when	1
the	1
melancholy	1
event	1
takes	1
place--which,	1
however,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
said,	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
for	1
several	1
years.	1
This	1
has	1
been	1
my	1
motive,	1
my	1
fair	1
cousin,	1
and	1
I	1
flatter	1
myself	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
sink	1
me	1
in	1
your	1
esteem.	1
And	1
now	1
nothing	1
remains	1
for	1
me	1
but	1
to	1
assure	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
animated	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
my	1
affection.	1
To	1
fortune	1
I	1
am	1
perfectly	1
indifferent,	1
and	1
shall	1
make	1
no	1
demand	1
of	1
that	1
nature	1
on	1
your	1
father,	1
since	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
aware	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
complied	1
with;	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
in	1
the	1
four	1
per	1
cents,	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
yours	1
till	1
after	1
your	1
mother's	1
decease,	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
ever	1
be	1
entitled	1
to.	1
On	1
that	1
head,	1
therefore,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
uniformly	1
silent;	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
assure	1
yourself	1
that	1
no	1
ungenerous	1
reproach	1
shall	1
ever	1
pass	1
my	1
lips	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
married."	1
It	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
to	1
interrupt	1
him	1
now.	1
"You	1
are	1
too	1
hasty,	1
sir,"	1
she	1
cried.	1
"You	1
forget	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
no	1
answer.	1
Let	1
me	1
do	1
it	1
without	1
further	1
loss	1
of	1
time.	1
Accept	1
my	1
thanks	1
for	1
the	1
compliment	1
you	1
are	1
paying	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sensible	1
of	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
your	1
proposals,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
otherwise	1
than	1
to	1
decline	1
them."	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
now	1
to	1
learn,"	1
replied	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
with	1
a	1
formal	1
wave	1
of	1
the	1
hand,	1
"that	1
it	1
is	1
usual	1
with	1
young	1
ladies	1
to	1
reject	1
the	1
addresses	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
they	1
secretly	1
mean	1
to	1
accept,	1
when	1
he	1
first	1
applies	1
for	1
their	1
favour;	1
and	1
that	1
sometimes	1
the	1
refusal	1
is	1
repeated	1
a	1
second,	1
or	1
even	1
a	1
third	1
time.	1
I	1
am	1
therefore	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
discouraged	1
by	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
just	1
said,	1
and	1
shall	1
hope	1
to	1
lead	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
altar	1
ere	1
long."	1
"Upon	1
my	1
word,	1
sir,"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth,	1
"your	1
hope	1
is	1
a	1
rather	1
extraordinary	1
one	1
after	1
my	1
declaration.	1
I	1
do	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
young	1
ladies	1
(if	1
such	1
young	1
ladies	1
there	1
are)	1
who	1
are	1
so	1
daring	1
as	1
to	1
risk	1
their	1
happiness	1
on	1
the	1
chance	1
of	1
being	1
asked	1
a	1
second	1
time.	1
I	1
am	1
perfectly	1
serious	1
in	1
my	1
refusal.	1
You	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
_me_	1
happy,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
last	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
who	1
could	1
make	1
you	1
so.	1
Nay,	1
were	1
your	1
friend	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
to	1
know	1
me,	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
she	1
would	1
find	1
me	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
ill	1
qualified	1
for	1
the	1
situation."	1
"Were	1
it	1
certain	1
that	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
would	1
think	1
so,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
very	1
gravely--"but	1
I	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
that	1
her	1
ladyship	1
would	1
at	1
all	1
disapprove	1
of	1
you.	1
And	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
certain	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
seeing	1
her	1
again,	1
I	1
shall	1
speak	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
highest	1
terms	1
of	1
your	1
modesty,	1
economy,	1
and	1
other	1
amiable	1
qualification."	1
"Indeed,	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
all	1
praise	1
of	1
me	1
will	1
be	1
unnecessary.	1
You	1
must	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
judge	1
for	1
myself,	1
and	1
pay	1
me	1
the	1
compliment	1
of	1
believing	1
what	1
I	1
say.	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
very	1
happy	1
and	1
very	1
rich,	1
and	1
by	1
refusing	1
your	1
hand,	1
do	1
all	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
prevent	1
your	1
being	1
otherwise.	1
In	1
making	1
me	1
the	1
offer,	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
satisfied	1
the	1
delicacy	1
of	1
your	1
feelings	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
my	1
family,	1
and	1
may	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
Longbourn	1
estate	1
whenever	1
it	1
falls,	1
without	1
any	1
self-reproach.	1
This	1
matter	1
may	1
be	1
considered,	1
therefore,	1
as	1
finally	1
settled."	1
And	1
rising	1
as	1
she	1
thus	1
spoke,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
quitted	1
the	1
room,	1
had	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
not	1
thus	1
addressed	1
her:	1
"When	1
I	1
do	1
myself	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
speaking	1
to	1
you	1
next	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
I	1
shall	1
hope	1
to	1
receive	1
a	1
more	1
favourable	1
answer	1
than	1
you	1
have	1
now	1
given	1
me;	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
far	1
from	1
accusing	1
you	1
of	1
cruelty	1
at	1
present,	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
established	1
custom	1
of	1
your	1
sex	1
to	1
reject	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
application,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
you	1
have	1
even	1
now	1
said	1
as	1
much	1
to	1
encourage	1
my	1
suit	1
as	1
would	1
be	1
consistent	1
with	1
the	1
true	1
delicacy	1
of	1
the	1
female	1
character."	1
"Really,	1
Mr.	1
Collins,"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth	1
with	1
some	1
warmth,	1
"you	1
puzzle	1
me	1
exceedingly.	1
If	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
hitherto	1
said	1
can	1
appear	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
encouragement,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
express	1
my	1
refusal	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
as	1
to	1
convince	1
you	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
one."	1
"You	1
must	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
flatter	1
myself,	1
my	1
dear	1
cousin,	1
that	1
your	1
refusal	1
of	1
my	1
addresses	1
is	1
merely	1
words	1
of	1
course.	1
My	1
reasons	1
for	1
believing	1
it	1
are	1
briefly	1
these:	1
It	1
does	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
my	1
hand	1
is	1
unworthy	1
your	1
acceptance,	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
establishment	1
I	1
can	1
offer	1
would	1
be	1
any	1
other	1
than	1
highly	1
desirable.	1
My	1
situation	1
in	1
life,	1
my	1
connections	1
with	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
de	1
Bourgh,	1
and	1
my	1
relationship	1
to	1
your	1
own,	1
are	1
circumstances	1
highly	1
in	1
my	1
favour;	1
and	1
you	1
should	1
take	1
it	1
into	1
further	1
consideration,	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
your	1
manifold	1
attractions,	1
it	1
is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
certain	1
that	1
another	1
offer	1
of	1
marriage	1
may	1
ever	1
be	1
made	1
you.	1
Your	1
portion	1
is	1
unhappily	1
so	1
small	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
in	1
all	1
likelihood	1
undo	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
your	1
loveliness	1
and	1
amiable	1
qualifications.	1
As	1
I	1
must	1
therefore	1
conclude	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
serious	1
in	1
your	1
rejection	1
of	1
me,	1
I	1
shall	1
choose	1
to	1
attribute	1
it	1
to	1
your	1
wish	1
of	1
increasing	1
my	1
love	1
by	1
suspense,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
usual	1
practice	1
of	1
elegant	1
females."	1
"I	1
do	1
assure	1
you,	1
sir,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
pretensions	1
whatever	1
to	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
elegance	1
which	1
consists	1
in	1
tormenting	1
a	1
respectable	1
man.	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
be	1
paid	1
the	1
compliment	1
of	1
being	1
believed	1
sincere.	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
for	1
the	1
honour	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
me	1
in	1
your	1
proposals,	1
but	1
to	1
accept	1
them	1
is	1
absolutely	1
impossible.	1
My	1
feelings	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
forbid	1
it.	1
Can	1
I	1
speak	1
plainer?	1
Do	1
not	1
consider	1
me	1
now	1
as	1
an	1
elegant	1
female,	1
intending	1
to	1
plague	1
you,	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
rational	1
creature,	1
speaking	1
the	1
truth	1
from	1
her	1
heart."	1
"You	1
are	1
uniformly	1
charming!"	1
cried	1
he,	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
awkward	1
gallantry;	1
"and	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
when	1
sanctioned	1
by	1
the	1
express	1
authority	1
of	1
both	1
your	1
excellent	1
parents,	1
my	1
proposals	1
will	1
not	1
fail	1
of	1
being	1
acceptable."	1
To	1
such	1
perseverance	1
in	1
wilful	1
self-deception	1
Elizabeth	1
would	1
make	1
no	1
reply,	1
and	1
immediately	1
and	1
in	1
silence	1
withdrew;	1
determined,	1
if	1
he	1
persisted	1
in	1
considering	1
her	1
repeated	1
refusals	1
as	1
flattering	1
encouragement,	1
to	1
apply	1
to	1
her	1
father,	1
whose	1
negative	1
might	1
be	1
uttered	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
decisive,	1
and	1
whose	1
behaviour	1
at	1
least	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
mistaken	1
for	1
the	1
affectation	1
and	1
coquetry	1
of	1
an	1
elegant	1
female.	1
Chapter	1
20	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
was	1
not	1
left	1
long	1
to	1
the	1
silent	1
contemplation	1
of	1
his	1
successful	1
love;	1
for	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
having	1
dawdled	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
vestibule	1
to	1
watch	1
for	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
conference,	1
no	1
sooner	1
saw	1
Elizabeth	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
with	1
quick	1
step	1
pass	1
her	1
towards	1
the	1
staircase,	1
than	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
breakfast-room,	1
and	1
congratulated	1
both	1
him	1
and	1
herself	1
in	1
warm	1
terms	1
on	1
the	1
happy	1
prospect	1
or	1
their	1
nearer	1
connection.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
received	1
and	1
returned	1
these	1
felicitations	1
with	1
equal	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
then	1
proceeded	1
to	1
relate	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
their	1
interview,	1
with	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
trusted	1
he	1
had	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied,	1
since	1
the	1
refusal	1
which	1
his	1
cousin	1
had	1
steadfastly	1
given	1
him	1
would	1
naturally	1
flow	1
from	1
her	1
bashful	1
modesty	1
and	1
the	1
genuine	1
delicacy	1
of	1
her	1
character.	1
This	1
information,	1
however,	1
startled	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet;	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
equally	1
satisfied	1
that	1
her	1
daughter	1
had	1
meant	1
to	1
encourage	1
him	1
by	1
protesting	1
against	1
his	1
proposals,	1
but	1
she	1
dared	1
not	1
believe	1
it,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
saying	1
so.	1
"But,	1
depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
Mr.	1
Collins,"	1
she	1
added,	1
"that	1
Lizzy	1
shall	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
reason.	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
about	1
it	1
directly.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
headstrong,	1
foolish	1
girl,	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
her	1
own	1
interest	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
_make_	1
her	1
know	1
it."	1
"Pardon	1
me	1
for	1
interrupting	1
you,	1
madam,"	1
cried	1
Mr.	1
Collins;	1
"but	1
if	1
she	1
is	1
really	1
headstrong	1
and	1
foolish,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
whether	1
she	1
would	1
altogether	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
desirable	1
wife	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
my	1
situation,	1
who	1
naturally	1
looks	1
for	1
happiness	1
in	1
the	1
marriage	1
state.	1
If	1
therefore	1
she	1
actually	1
persists	1
in	1
rejecting	1
my	1
suit,	1
perhaps	1
it	1
were	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
force	1
her	1
into	1
accepting	1
me,	1
because	1
if	1
liable	1
to	1
such	1
defects	1
of	1
temper,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
contribute	1
much	1
to	1
my	1
felicity."	1
"Sir,	1
you	1
quite	1
misunderstand	1
me,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
alarmed.	1
"Lizzy	1
is	1
only	1
headstrong	1
in	1
such	1
matters	1
as	1
these.	1
In	1
everything	1
else	1
she	1
is	1
as	1
good-natured	1
a	1
girl	1
as	1
ever	1
lived.	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
directly	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
very	1
soon	1
settle	1
it	1
with	1
her,	1
I	1
am	1
sure."	1
She	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
him	1
time	1
to	1
reply,	1
but	1
hurrying	1
instantly	1
to	1
her	1
husband,	1
called	1
out	1
as	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
library,	1
"Oh!	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
you	1
are	1
wanted	1
immediately;	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
in	1
an	1
uproar.	1
You	1
must	1
come	1
and	1
make	1
Lizzy	1
marry	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
for	1
she	1
vows	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
him,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
haste	1
he	1
will	1
change	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
not	1
have	1
_her_."	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes	1
from	1
his	1
book	1
as	1
she	1
entered,	1
and	1
fixed	1
them	1
on	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
a	1
calm	1
unconcern	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
altered	1
by	1
her	1
communication.	1
"I	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
understanding	1
you,"	1
said	1
he,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
her	1
speech.	1
"Of	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
talking?"	1
"Of	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
and	1
Lizzy.	1
Lizzy	1
declares	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
begins	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
Lizzy."	1
"And	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
on	1
the	1
occasion?	1
It	1
seems	1
an	1
hopeless	1
business."	1
"Speak	1
to	1
Lizzy	1
about	1
it	1
yourself.	1
Tell	1
her	1
that	1
you	1
insist	1
upon	1
her	1
marrying	1
him."	1
"Let	1
her	1
be	1
called	1
down.	1
She	1
shall	1
hear	1
my	1
opinion."	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
rang	1
the	1
bell,	1
and	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
summoned	1
to	1
the	1
library.	1
"Come	1
here,	1
child,"	1
cried	1
her	1
father	1
as	1
she	1
appeared.	1
"I	1
have	1
sent	1
for	1
you	1
on	1
an	1
affair	1
of	1
importance.	1
I	1
understand	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
has	1
made	1
you	1
an	1
offer	1
of	1
marriage.	1
Is	1
it	1
true?"	1
Elizabeth	1
replied	1
that	1
it	1
was.	1
"Very	1
well--and	1
this	1
offer	1
of	1
marriage	1
you	1
have	1
refused?"	1
"I	1
have,	1
sir."	1
"Very	1
well.	1
We	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
point.	1
Your	1
mother	1
insists	1
upon	1
your	1
accepting	1
it.	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
so,	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet?"	1
"Yes,	1
or	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
see	1
her	1
again."	1
"An	1
unhappy	1
alternative	1
is	1
before	1
you,	1
Elizabeth.	1
From	1
this	1
day	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
stranger	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
parents.	1
Your	1
mother	1
will	1
never	1
see	1
you	1
again	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
_not_	1
marry	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
never	1
see	1
you	1
again	1
if	1
you	1
_do_."	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
smile	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
conclusion	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
beginning,	1
but	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
who	1
had	1
persuaded	1
herself	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
regarded	1
the	1
affair	1
as	1
she	1
wished,	1
was	1
excessively	1
disappointed.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean,	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
in	1
talking	1
this	1
way?	1
You	1
promised	1
me	1
to	1
_insist_	1
upon	1
her	1
marrying	1
him."	1
"My	1
dear,"	1
replied	1
her	1
husband,	1
"I	1
have	1
two	1
small	1
favours	1
to	1
request.	1
First,	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
allow	1
me	1
the	1
free	1
use	1
of	1
my	1
understanding	1
on	1
the	1
present	1
occasion;	1
and	1
secondly,	1
of	1
my	1
room.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
library	1
to	1
myself	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
may	1
be."	1
Not	1
yet,	1
however,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
disappointment	1
in	1
her	1
husband,	1
did	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
point.	1
She	1
talked	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
again	1
and	1
again;	1
coaxed	1
and	1
threatened	1
her	1
by	1
turns.	1
She	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
secure	1
Jane	1
in	1
her	1
interest;	1
but	1
Jane,	1
with	1
all	1
possible	1
mildness,	1
declined	1
interfering;	1
and	1
Elizabeth,	1
sometimes	1
with	1
real	1
earnestness,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
with	1
playful	1
gaiety,	1
replied	1
to	1
her	1
attacks.	1
Though	1
her	1
manner	1
varied,	1
however,	1
her	1
determination	1
never	1
did.	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
meanwhile,	1
was	1
meditating	1
in	1
solitude	1
on	1
what	1
had	1
passed.	1
He	1
thought	1
too	1
well	1
of	1
himself	1
to	1
comprehend	1
on	1
what	1
motives	1
his	1
cousin	1
could	1
refuse	1
him;	1
and	1
though	1
his	1
pride	1
was	1
hurt,	1
he	1
suffered	1
in	1
no	1
other	1
way.	1
His	1
regard	1
for	1
her	1
was	1
quite	1
imaginary;	1
and	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
her	1
deserving	1
her	1
mother's	1
reproach	1
prevented	1
his	1
feeling	1
any	1
regret.	1
While	1
the	1
family	1
were	1
in	1
this	1
confusion,	1
Charlotte	1
Lucas	1
came	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
day	1
with	1
them.	1
She	1
was	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
vestibule	1
by	1
Lydia,	1
who,	1
flying	1
to	1
her,	1
cried	1
in	1
a	1
half	1
whisper,	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
you	1
are	1
come,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
such	1
fun	1
here!	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
has	1
happened	1
this	1
morning?	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
has	1
made	1
an	1
offer	1
to	1
Lizzy,	1
and	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
him."	1
Charlotte	1
hardly	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
answer,	1
before	1
they	1
were	1
joined	1
by	1
Kitty,	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
same	1
news;	1
and	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
breakfast-room,	1
where	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
alone,	1
than	1
she	1
likewise	1
began	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
calling	1
on	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
for	1
her	1
compassion,	1
and	1
entreating	1
her	1
to	1
persuade	1
her	1
friend	1
Lizzy	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
all	1
her	1
family.	1
"Pray	1
do,	1
my	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Lucas,"	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
melancholy	1
tone,	1
"for	1
nobody	1
is	1
on	1
my	1
side,	1
nobody	1
takes	1
part	1
with	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
cruelly	1
used,	1
nobody	1
feels	1
for	1
my	1
poor	1
nerves."	1
Charlotte's	1
reply	1
was	1
spared	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
Jane	1
and	1
Elizabeth.	1
"Aye,	1
there	1
she	1
comes,"	1
continued	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
"looking	1
as	1
unconcerned	1
as	1
may	1
be,	1
and	1
caring	1
no	1
more	1
for	1
us	1
than	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
at	1
York,	1
provided	1
she	1
can	1
have	1
her	1
own	1
way.	1
But	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
Miss	1
Lizzy--if	1
you	1
take	1
it	1
into	1
your	1
head	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
refusing	1
every	1
offer	1
of	1
marriage	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
get	1
a	1
husband	1
at	1
all--and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
who	1
is	1
to	1
maintain	1
you	1
when	1
your	1
father	1
is	1
dead.	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
you--and	1
so	1
I	1
warn	1
you.	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
you	1
from	1
this	1
very	1
day.	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
library,	1
you	1
know,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
again,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
me	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
my	1
word.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
talking	1
to	1
undutiful	1
children.	1
Not	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
much	1
pleasure,	1
indeed,	1
in	1
talking	1
to	1
anybody.	1
People	1
who	1
suffer	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
from	1
nervous	1
complaints	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
great	1
inclination	1
for	1
talking.	1
Nobody	1
can	1
tell	1
what	1
I	1
suffer!	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
so.	1
Those	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
complain	1
are	1
never	1
pitied."	1
Her	1
daughters	1
listened	1
in	1
silence	1
to	1
this	1
effusion,	1
sensible	1
that	1
any	1
attempt	1
to	1
reason	1
with	1
her	1
or	1
soothe	1
her	1
would	1
only	1
increase	1
the	1
irritation.	1
She	1
talked	1
on,	1
therefore,	1
without	1
interruption	1
from	1
any	1
of	1
them,	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
joined	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
who	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
more	1
stately	1
than	1
usual,	1
and	1
on	1
perceiving	1
whom,	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
girls,	1
"Now,	1
I	1
do	1
insist	1
upon	1
it,	1
that	1
you,	1
all	1
of	1
you,	1
hold	1
your	1
tongues,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
conversation	1
together."	1
Elizabeth	1
passed	1
quietly	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
Jane	1
and	1
Kitty	1
followed,	1
but	1
Lydia	1
stood	1
her	1
ground,	1
determined	1
to	1
hear	1
all	1
she	1
could;	1
and	1
Charlotte,	1
detained	1
first	1
by	1
the	1
civility	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
whose	1
inquiries	1
after	1
herself	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
family	1
were	1
very	1
minute,	1
and	1
then	1
by	1
a	1
little	1
curiosity,	1
satisfied	1
herself	1
with	1
walking	1
to	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
pretending	1
not	1
to	1
hear.	1
In	1
a	1
doleful	1
voice	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
began	1
the	1
projected	1
conversation:	1
"Oh!	1
Mr.	1
Collins!"	1
"My	1
dear	1
madam,"	1
replied	1
he,	1
"let	1
us	1
be	1
for	1
ever	1
silent	1
on	1
this	1
point.	1
Far	1
be	1
it	1
from	1
me,"	1
he	1
presently	1
continued,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
marked	1
his	1
displeasure,	1
"to	1
resent	1
the	1
behaviour	1
of	1
your	1
daughter.	1
Resignation	1
to	1
inevitable	1
evils	1
is	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
us	1
all;	1
the	1
peculiar	1
duty	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
fortunate	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
early	1
preferment;	1
and	1
I	1
trust	1
I	1
am	1
resigned.	1
Perhaps	1
not	1
the	1
less	1
so	1
from	1
feeling	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
my	1
positive	1
happiness	1
had	1
my	1
fair	1
cousin	1
honoured	1
me	1
with	1
her	1
hand;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
often	1
observed	1
that	1
resignation	1
is	1
never	1
so	1
perfect	1
as	1
when	1
the	1
blessing	1
denied	1
begins	1
to	1
lose	1
somewhat	1
of	1
its	1
value	1
in	1
our	1
estimation.	1
You	1
will	1
not,	1
I	1
hope,	1
consider	1
me	1
as	1
showing	1
any	1
disrespect	1
to	1
your	1
family,	1
my	1
dear	1
madam,	1
by	1
thus	1
withdrawing	1
my	1
pretensions	1
to	1
your	1
daughter's	1
favour,	1
without	1
having	1
paid	1
yourself	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
the	1
compliment	1
of	1
requesting	1
you	1
to	1
interpose	1
your	1
authority	1
in	1
my	1
behalf.	1
My	1
conduct	1
may,	1
I	1
fear,	1
be	1
objectionable	1
in	1
having	1
accepted	1
my	1
dismission	1
from	1
your	1
daughter's	1
lips	1
instead	1
of	1
your	1
own.	1
But	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
liable	1
to	1
error.	1
I	1
have	1
certainly	1
meant	1
well	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
affair.	1
My	1
object	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
secure	1
an	1
amiable	1
companion	1
for	1
myself,	1
with	1
due	1
consideration	1
for	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
all	1
your	1
family,	1
and	1
if	1
my	1
_manner_	1
has	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
reprehensible,	1
I	1
here	1
beg	1
leave	1
to	1
apologise."	1
Chapter	1
21	1
The	1
discussion	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
offer	1
was	1
now	1
nearly	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
suffer	1
from	1
the	1
uncomfortable	1
feelings	1
necessarily	1
attending	1
it,	1
and	1
occasionally	1
from	1
some	1
peevish	1
allusions	1
of	1
her	1
mother.	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
gentleman	1
himself,	1
_his_	1
feelings	1
were	1
chiefly	1
expressed,	1
not	1
by	1
embarrassment	1
or	1
dejection,	1
or	1
by	1
trying	1
to	1
avoid	1
her,	1
but	1
by	1
stiffness	1
of	1
manner	1
and	1
resentful	1
silence.	1
He	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
spoke	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
the	1
assiduous	1
attentions	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
sensible	1
of	1
himself	1
were	1
transferred	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
to	1
Miss	1
Lucas,	1
whose	1
civility	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
a	1
seasonable	1
relief	1
to	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
especially	1
to	1
her	1
friend.	1
The	1
morrow	1
produced	1
no	1
abatement	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet's	1
ill-humour	1
or	1
ill	1
health.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
was	1
also	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
of	1
angry	1
pride.	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
hoped	1
that	1
his	1
resentment	1
might	1
shorten	1
his	1
visit,	1
but	1
his	1
plan	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
affected	1
by	1
it.	1
He	1
was	1
always	1
to	1
have	1
gone	1
on	1
Saturday,	1
and	1
to	1
Saturday	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
stay.	1
After	1
breakfast,	1
the	1
girls	1
walked	1
to	1
Meryton	1
to	1
inquire	1
if	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
were	1
returned,	1
and	1
to	1
lament	1
over	1
his	1
absence	1
from	1
the	1
Netherfield	1
ball.	1
He	1
joined	1
them	1
on	1
their	1
entering	1
the	1
town,	1
and	1
attended	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
aunt's	1
where	1
his	1
regret	1
and	1
vexation,	1
and	1
the	1
concern	1
of	1
everybody,	1
was	1
well	1
talked	1
over.	1
To	1
Elizabeth,	1
however,	1
he	1
voluntarily	1
acknowledged	1
that	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
his	1
absence	1
_had_	1
been	1
self-imposed.	1
"I	1
found,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"as	1
the	1
time	1
drew	1
near	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
meet	1
Mr.	1
Darcy;	1
that	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
room,	1
the	1
same	1
party	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
hours	1
together,	1
might	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
could	1
bear,	1
and	1
that	1
scenes	1
might	1
arise	1
unpleasant	1
to	1
more	1
than	1
myself."	1
She	1
highly	1
approved	1
his	1
forbearance,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
leisure	1
for	1
a	1
full	1
discussion	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
commendation	1
which	1
they	1
civilly	1
bestowed	1
on	1
each	1
other,	1
as	1
Wickham	1
and	1
another	1
officer	1
walked	1
back	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
Longbourn,	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
walk	1
he	1
particularly	1
attended	1
to	1
her.	1
His	1
accompanying	1
them	1
was	1
a	1
double	1
advantage;	1
she	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
compliment	1
it	1
offered	1
to	1
herself,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
most	1
acceptable	1
as	1
an	1
occasion	1
of	1
introducing	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
mother.	1
Soon	1
after	1
their	1
return,	1
a	1
letter	1
was	1
delivered	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bennet;	1
it	1
came	1
from	1
Netherfield.	1
The	1
envelope	1
contained	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
elegant,	1
little,	1
hot-pressed	1
paper,	1
well	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
lady's	1
fair,	1
flowing	1
hand;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
saw	1
her	1
sister's	1
countenance	1
change	1
as	1
she	1
read	1
it,	1
and	1
saw	1
her	1
dwelling	1
intently	1
on	1
some	1
particular	1
passages.	1
Jane	1
recollected	1
herself	1
soon,	1
and	1
putting	1
the	1
letter	1
away,	1
tried	1
to	1
join	1
with	1
her	1
usual	1
cheerfulness	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
conversation;	1
but	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
an	1
anxiety	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
which	1
drew	1
off	1
her	1
attention	1
even	1
from	1
Wickham;	1
and	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
taken	1
leave,	1
than	1
a	1
glance	1
from	1
Jane	1
invited	1
her	1
to	1
follow	1
her	1
up	1
stairs.	1
When	1
they	1
had	1
gained	1
their	1
own	1
room,	1
Jane,	1
taking	1
out	1
the	1
letter,	1
said:	1
"This	1
is	1
from	1
Caroline	1
Bingley;	1
what	1
it	1
contains	1
has	1
surprised	1
me	1
a	1
good	1
deal.	1
The	1
whole	1
party	1
have	1
left	1
Netherfield	1
by	1
this	1
time,	1
and	1
are	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
town--and	1
without	1
any	1
intention	1
of	1
coming	1
back	1
again.	1
You	1
shall	1
hear	1
what	1
she	1
says."	1
She	1
then	1
read	1
the	1
first	1
sentence	1
aloud,	1
which	1
comprised	1
the	1
information	1
of	1
their	1
having	1
just	1
resolved	1
to	1
follow	1
their	1
brother	1
to	1
town	1
directly,	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
meaning	1
to	1
dine	1
in	1
Grosvenor	1
Street,	1
where	1
Mr.	1
Hurst	1
had	1
a	1
house.	1
The	1
next	1
was	1
in	1
these	1
words:	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
pretend	1
to	1
regret	1
anything	1
I	1
shall	1
leave	1
in	1
Hertfordshire,	1
except	1
your	1
society,	1
my	1
dearest	1
friend;	1
but	1
we	1
will	1
hope,	1
at	1
some	1
future	1
period,	1
to	1
enjoy	1
many	1
returns	1
of	1
that	1
delightful	1
intercourse	1
we	1
have	1
known,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
meanwhile	1
may	1
lessen	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
separation	1
by	1
a	1
very	1
frequent	1
and	1
most	1
unreserved	1
correspondence.	1
I	1
depend	1
on	1
you	1
for	1
that."	1
To	1
these	1
highflown	1
expressions	1
Elizabeth	1
listened	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
insensibility	1
of	1
distrust;	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
suddenness	1
of	1
their	1
removal	1
surprised	1
her,	1
she	1
saw	1
nothing	1
in	1
it	1
really	1
to	1
lament;	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
their	1
absence	1
from	1
Netherfield	1
would	1
prevent	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
being	1
there;	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
their	1
society,	1
she	1
was	1
persuaded	1
that	1
Jane	1
must	1
cease	1
to	1
regard	1
it,	1
in	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
his.	1
"It	1
is	1
unlucky,"	1
said	1
she,	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause,	1
"that	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
friends	1
before	1
they	1
leave	1
the	1
country.	1
But	1
may	1
we	1
not	1
hope	1
that	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
future	1
happiness	1
to	1
which	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
looks	1
forward	1
may	1
arrive	1
earlier	1
than	1
she	1
is	1
aware,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
delightful	1
intercourse	1
you	1
have	1
known	1
as	1
friends	1
will	1
be	1
renewed	1
with	1
yet	1
greater	1
satisfaction	1
as	1
sisters?	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
detained	1
in	1
London	1
by	1
them."	1
"Caroline	1
decidedly	1
says	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
will	1
return	1
into	1
Hertfordshire	1
this	1
winter.	1
I	1
will	1
read	1
it	1
to	1
you:"	1
"When	1
my	1
brother	1
left	1
us	1
yesterday,	1
he	1
imagined	1
that	1
the	1
business	1
which	1
took	1
him	1
to	1
London	1
might	1
be	1
concluded	1
in	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
days;	1
but	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
certain	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
so,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
convinced	1
that	1
when	1
Charles	1
gets	1
to	1
town	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
no	1
hurry	1
to	1
leave	1
it	1
again,	1
we	1
have	1
determined	1
on	1
following	1
him	1
thither,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
spend	1
his	1
vacant	1
hours	1
in	1
a	1
comfortless	1
hotel.	1
Many	1
of	1
my	1
acquaintances	1
are	1
already	1
there	1
for	1
the	1
winter;	1
I	1
wish	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
hear	1
that	1
you,	1
my	1
dearest	1
friend,	1
had	1
any	1
intention	1
of	1
making	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
crowd--but	1
of	1
that	1
I	1
despair.	1
I	1
sincerely	1
hope	1
your	1
Christmas	1
in	1
Hertfordshire	1
may	1
abound	1
in	1
the	1
gaieties	1
which	1
that	1
season	1
generally	1
brings,	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
beaux	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
numerous	1
as	1
to	1
prevent	1
your	1
feeling	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
of	1
whom	1
we	1
shall	1
deprive	1
you."	1
"It	1
is	1
evident	1
by	1
this,"	1
added	1
Jane,	1
"that	1
he	1
comes	1
back	1
no	1
more	1
this	1
winter."	1
"It	1
is	1
only	1
evident	1
that	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
does	1
not	1
mean	1
that	1
he	1
_should_."	1
"Why	1
will	1
you	1
think	1
so?	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
his	1
own	1
doing.	1
He	1
is	1
his	1
own	1
master.	1
But	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
_all_.	1
I	1
_will_	1
read	1
you	1
the	1
passage	1
which	1
particularly	1
hurts	1
me.	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
reserves	1
from	1
_you_."	1
"Mr.	1
Darcy	1
is	1
impatient	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
sister;	1
and,	1
to	1
confess	1
the	1
truth,	1
_we_	1
are	1
scarcely	1
less	1
eager	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
again.	1
I	1
really	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
Georgiana	1
Darcy	1
has	1
her	1
equal	1
for	1
beauty,	1
elegance,	1
and	1
accomplishments;	1
and	1
the	1
affection	1
she	1
inspires	1
in	1
Louisa	1
and	1
myself	1
is	1
heightened	1
into	1
something	1
still	1
more	1
interesting,	1
from	1
the	1
hope	1
we	1
dare	1
entertain	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
hereafter	1
our	1
sister.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
whether	1
I	1
ever	1
before	1
mentioned	1
to	1
you	1
my	1
feelings	1
on	1
this	1
subject;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
country	1
without	1
confiding	1
them,	1
and	1
I	1
trust	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
esteem	1
them	1
unreasonable.	1
My	1
brother	1
admires	1
her	1
greatly	1
already;	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
frequent	1
opportunity	1
now	1
of	1
seeing	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
intimate	1
footing;	1
her	1
relations	1
all	1
wish	1
the	1
connection	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
his	1
own;	1
and	1
a	1
sister's	1
partiality	1
is	1
not	1
misleading	1
me,	1
I	1
think,	1
when	1
I	1
call	1
Charles	1
most	1
capable	1
of	1
engaging	1
any	1
woman's	1
heart.	1
With	1
all	1
these	1
circumstances	1
to	1
favour	1
an	1
attachment,	1
and	1
nothing	1
to	1
prevent	1
it,	1
am	1
I	1
wrong,	1
my	1
dearest	1
Jane,	1
in	1
indulging	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
an	1
event	1
which	1
will	1
secure	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
so	1
many?"	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
_this_	1
sentence,	1
my	1
dear	1
Lizzy?"	1
said	1
Jane	1
as	1
she	1
finished	1
it.	1
"Is	1
it	1
not	1
clear	1
enough?	1
Does	1
it	1
not	1
expressly	1
declare	1
that	1
Caroline	1
neither	1
expects	1
nor	1
wishes	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
sister;	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
perfectly	1
convinced	1
of	1
her	1
brother's	1
indifference;	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
suspects	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
my	1
feelings	1
for	1
him,	1
she	1
means	1
(most	1
kindly!)	1
to	1
put	1
me	1
on	1
my	1
guard?	1
Can	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
other	1
opinion	1
on	1
the	1
subject?"	1
"Yes,	1
there	1
can;	1
for	1
mine	1
is	1
totally	1
different.	1
Will	1
you	1
hear	1
it?"	1
"Most	1
willingly."	1
"You	1
shall	1
have	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words.	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
sees	1
that	1
her	1
brother	1
is	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
wants	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
Miss	1
Darcy.	1
She	1
follows	1
him	1
to	1
town	1
in	1
hope	1
of	1
keeping	1
him	1
there,	1
and	1
tries	1
to	1
persuade	1
you	1
that	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
care	1
about	1
you."	1
Jane	1
shook	1
her	1
head.	1
"Indeed,	1
Jane,	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
believe	1
me.	1
No	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
ever	1
seen	1
you	1
together	1
can	1
doubt	1
his	1
affection.	1
Miss	1
Bingley,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
cannot.	1
She	1
is	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
simpleton.	1
Could	1
she	1
have	1
seen	1
half	1
as	1
much	1
love	1
in	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
for	1
herself,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
ordered	1
her	1
wedding	1
clothes.	1
But	1
the	1
case	1
is	1
this:	1
We	1
are	1
not	1
rich	1
enough	1
or	1
grand	1
enough	1
for	1
them;	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
for	1
her	1
brother,	1
from	1
the	1
notion	1
that	1
when	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
_one_	1
intermarriage,	1
she	1
may	1
have	1
less	1
trouble	1
in	1
achieving	1
a	1
second;	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
certainly	1
some	1
ingenuity,	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
it	1
would	1
succeed,	1
if	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way.	1
But,	1
my	1
dearest	1
Jane,	1
you	1
cannot	1
seriously	1
imagine	1
that	1
because	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
tells	1
you	1
her	1
brother	1
greatly	1
admires	1
Miss	1
Darcy,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
smallest	1
degree	1
less	1
sensible	1
of	1
_your_	1
merit	1
than	1
when	1
he	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
you	1
on	1
Tuesday,	1
or	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
persuade	1
him	1
that,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you,	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
friend."	1
"If	1
we	1
thought	1
alike	1
of	1
Miss	1
Bingley,"	1
replied	1
Jane,	1
"your	1
representation	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
might	1
make	1
me	1
quite	1
easy.	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
foundation	1
is	1
unjust.	1
Caroline	1
is	1
incapable	1
of	1
wilfully	1
deceiving	1
anyone;	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
hope	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
is	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
deceiving	1
herself."	1
"That	1
is	1
right.	1
You	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
started	1
a	1
more	1
happy	1
idea,	1
since	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
comfort	1
in	1
mine.	1
Believe	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
deceived,	1
by	1
all	1
means.	1
You	1
have	1
now	1
done	1
your	1
duty	1
by	1
her,	1
and	1
must	1
fret	1
no	1
longer."	1
"But,	1
my	1
dear	1
sister,	1
can	1
I	1
be	1
happy,	1
even	1
supposing	1
the	1
best,	1
in	1
accepting	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
sisters	1
and	1
friends	1
are	1
all	1
wishing	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
elsewhere?"	1
"You	1
must	1
decide	1
for	1
yourself,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth;	1
"and	1
if,	1
upon	1
mature	1
deliberation,	1
you	1
find	1
that	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
disobliging	1
his	1
two	1
sisters	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
equivalent	1
to	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
being	1
his	1
wife,	1
I	1
advise	1
you	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
to	1
refuse	1
him."	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
talk	1
so?"	1
said	1
Jane,	1
faintly	1
smiling.	1
"You	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
though	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
exceedingly	1
grieved	1
at	1
their	1
disapprobation,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
hesitate."	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
you	1
would;	1
and	1
that	1
being	1
the	1
case,	1
I	1
cannot	1
consider	1
your	1
situation	1
with	1
much	1
compassion."	1
"But	1
if	1
he	1
returns	1
no	1
more	1
this	1
winter,	1
my	1
choice	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
required.	1
A	1
thousand	1
things	1
may	1
arise	1
in	1
six	1
months!"	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
returning	1
no	1
more	1
Elizabeth	1
treated	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
contempt.	1
It	1
appeared	1
to	1
her	1
merely	1
the	1
suggestion	1
of	1
Caroline's	1
interested	1
wishes,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
suppose	1
that	1
those	1
wishes,	1
however	1
openly	1
or	1
artfully	1
spoken,	1
could	1
influence	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
so	1
totally	1
independent	1
of	1
everyone.	1
She	1
represented	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
as	1
forcibly	1
as	1
possible	1
what	1
she	1
felt	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
and	1
had	1
soon	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
seeing	1
its	1
happy	1
effect.	1
Jane's	1
temper	1
was	1
not	1
desponding,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
gradually	1
led	1
to	1
hope,	1
though	1
the	1
diffidence	1
of	1
affection	1
sometimes	1
overcame	1
the	1
hope,	1
that	1
Bingley	1
would	1
return	1
to	1
Netherfield	1
and	1
answer	1
every	1
wish	1
of	1
her	1
heart.	1
They	1
agreed	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
should	1
only	1
hear	1
of	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
without	1
being	1
alarmed	1
on	1
the	1
score	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman's	1
conduct;	1
but	1
even	1
this	1
partial	1
communication	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
concern,	1
and	1
she	1
bewailed	1
it	1
as	1
exceedingly	1
unlucky	1
that	1
the	1
ladies	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
getting	1
so	1
intimate	1
together.	1
After	1
lamenting	1
it,	1
however,	1
at	1
some	1
length,	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
consolation	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
would	1
be	1
soon	1
down	1
again	1
and	1
soon	1
dining	1
at	1
Longbourn,	1
and	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
the	1
comfortable	1
declaration,	1
that	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
invited	1
only	1
to	1
a	1
family	1
dinner,	1
she	1
would	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
have	1
two	1
full	1
courses.	1
Chapter	1
22	1
The	1
Bennets	1
were	1
engaged	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
the	1
Lucases	1
and	1
again	1
during	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
so	1
kind	1
as	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Collins.	1
Elizabeth	1
took	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
thanking	1
her.	1
"It	1
keeps	1
him	1
in	1
good	1
humour,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"and	1
I	1
am	1
more	1
obliged	1
to	1
you	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
express."	1
Charlotte	1
assured	1
her	1
friend	1
of	1
her	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
being	1
useful,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
amply	1
repaid	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
little	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
her	1
time.	1
This	1
was	1
very	1
amiable,	1
but	1
Charlotte's	1
kindness	1
extended	1
farther	1
than	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
any	1
conception	1
of;	1
its	1
object	1
was	1
nothing	1
else	1
than	1
to	1
secure	1
her	1
from	1
any	1
return	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
addresses,	1
by	1
engaging	1
them	1
towards	1
herself.	1
Such	1
was	1
Miss	1
Lucas's	1
scheme;	1
and	1
appearances	1
were	1
so	1
favourable,	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
parted	1
at	1
night,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
felt	1
almost	1
secure	1
of	1
success	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
to	1
leave	1
Hertfordshire	1
so	1
very	1
soon.	1
But	1
here	1
she	1
did	1
injustice	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
independence	1
of	1
his	1
character,	1
for	1
it	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
Longbourn	1
House	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
with	1
admirable	1
slyness,	1
and	1
hasten	1
to	1
Lucas	1
Lodge	1
to	1
throw	1
himself	1
at	1
her	1
feet.	1
He	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
notice	1
of	1
his	1
cousins,	1
from	1
a	1
conviction	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
depart,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
conjecture	1
his	1
design,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
willing	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
attempt	1
known	1
till	1
its	1
success	1
might	1
be	1
known	1
likewise;	1
for	1
though	1
feeling	1
almost	1
secure,	1
and	1
with	1
reason,	1
for	1
Charlotte	1
had	1
been	1
tolerably	1
encouraging,	1
he	1
was	1
comparatively	1
diffident	1
since	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
Wednesday.	1
His	1
reception,	1
however,	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
flattering	1
kind.	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
perceived	1
him	1
from	1
an	1
upper	1
window	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
towards	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
instantly	1
set	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
accidentally	1
in	1
the	1
lane.	1
But	1
little	1
had	1
she	1
dared	1
to	1
hope	1
that	1
so	1
much	1
love	1
and	1
eloquence	1
awaited	1
her	1
there.	1
In	1
as	1
short	1
a	1
time	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
long	1
speeches	1
would	1
allow,	1
everything	1
was	1
settled	1
between	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
both;	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
earnestly	1
entreated	1
her	1
to	1
name	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
the	1
happiest	1
of	1
men;	1
and	1
though	1
such	1
a	1
solicitation	1
must	1
be	1
waived	1
for	1
the	1
present,	1
the	1
lady	1
felt	1
no	1
inclination	1
to	1
trifle	1
with	1
his	1
happiness.	1
The	1
stupidity	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
favoured	1
by	1
nature	1
must	1
guard	1
his	1
courtship	1
from	1
any	1
charm	1
that	1
could	1
make	1
a	1
woman	1
wish	1
for	1
its	1
continuance;	1
and	1
Miss	1
Lucas,	1
who	1
accepted	1
him	1
solely	1
from	1
the	1
pure	1
and	1
disinterested	1
desire	1
of	1
an	1
establishment,	1
cared	1
not	1
how	1
soon	1
that	1
establishment	1
were	1
gained.	1
Sir	1
William	1
and	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
were	1
speedily	1
applied	1
to	1
for	1
their	1
consent;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
bestowed	1
with	1
a	1
most	1
joyful	1
alacrity.	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
present	1
circumstances	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
most	1
eligible	1
match	1
for	1
their	1
daughter,	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
could	1
give	1
little	1
fortune;	1
and	1
his	1
prospects	1
of	1
future	1
wealth	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
fair.	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
began	1
directly	1
to	1
calculate,	1
with	1
more	1
interest	1
than	1
the	1
matter	1
had	1
ever	1
excited	1
before,	1
how	1
many	1
years	1
longer	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
live;	1
and	1
Sir	1
William	1
gave	1
it	1
as	1
his	1
decided	1
opinion,	1
that	1
whenever	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
Longbourn	1
estate,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
highly	1
expedient	1
that	1
both	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
should	1
make	1
their	1
appearance	1
at	1
St.	1
James's.	1
The	1
whole	1
family,	1
in	1
short,	1
were	1
properly	1
overjoyed	1
on	1
the	1
occasion.	1
The	1
younger	1
girls	1
formed	1
hopes	1
of	1
_coming	1
out_	1
a	1
year	1
or	1
two	1
sooner	1
than	1
they	1
might	1
otherwise	1
have	1
done;	1
and	1
the	1
boys	1
were	1
relieved	1
from	1
their	1
apprehension	1
of	1
Charlotte's	1
dying	1
an	1
old	1
maid.	1
Charlotte	1
herself	1
was	1
tolerably	1
composed.	1
She	1
had	1
gained	1
her	1
point,	1
and	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
consider	1
of	1
it.	1
Her	1
reflections	1
were	1
in	1
general	1
satisfactory.	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
was	1
neither	1
sensible	1
nor	1
agreeable;	1
his	1
society	1
was	1
irksome,	1
and	1
his	1
attachment	1
to	1
her	1
must	1
be	1
imaginary.	1
But	1
still	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
her	1
husband.	1
Without	1
thinking	1
highly	1
either	1
of	1
men	1
or	1
matrimony,	1
marriage	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
her	1
object;	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
provision	1
for	1
well-educated	1
young	1
women	1
of	1
small	1
fortune,	1
and	1
however	1
uncertain	1
of	1
giving	1
happiness,	1
must	1
be	1
their	1
pleasantest	1
preservative	1
from	1
want.	1
This	1
preservative	1
she	1
had	1
now	1
obtained;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
twenty-seven,	1
without	1
having	1
ever	1
been	1
handsome,	1
she	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
luck	1
of	1
it.	1
The	1
least	1
agreeable	1
circumstance	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
was	1
the	1
surprise	1
it	1
must	1
occasion	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
Bennet,	1
whose	1
friendship	1
she	1
valued	1
beyond	1
that	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
person.	1
Elizabeth	1
would	1
wonder,	1
and	1
probably	1
would	1
blame	1
her;	1
and	1
though	1
her	1
resolution	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
shaken,	1
her	1
feelings	1
must	1
be	1
hurt	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
disapprobation.	1
She	1
resolved	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
the	1
information	1
herself,	1
and	1
therefore	1
charged	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
Longbourn	1
to	1
dinner,	1
to	1
drop	1
no	1
hint	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
before	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
family.	1
A	1
promise	1
of	1
secrecy	1
was	1
of	1
course	1
very	1
dutifully	1
given,	1
but	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
kept	1
without	1
difficulty;	1
for	1
the	1
curiosity	1
excited	1
by	1
his	1
long	1
absence	1
burst	1
forth	1
in	1
such	1
very	1
direct	1
questions	1
on	1
his	1
return	1
as	1
required	1
some	1
ingenuity	1
to	1
evade,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
exercising	1
great	1
self-denial,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
longing	1
to	1
publish	1
his	1
prosperous	1
love.	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
begin	1
his	1
journey	1
too	1
early	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
to	1
see	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
the	1
ceremony	1
of	1
leave-taking	1
was	1
performed	1
when	1
the	1
ladies	1
moved	1
for	1
the	1
night;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
with	1
great	1
politeness	1
and	1
cordiality,	1
said	1
how	1
happy	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
again,	1
whenever	1
his	1
engagements	1
might	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
visit	1
them.	1
"My	1
dear	1
madam,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
"this	1
invitation	1
is	1
particularly	1
gratifying,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
hoping	1
to	1
receive;	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
certain	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
avail	1
myself	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible."	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
astonished;	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
who	1
could	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
wish	1
for	1
so	1
speedy	1
a	1
return,	1
immediately	1
said:	1
"But	1
is	1
there	1
not	1
danger	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine's	1
disapprobation	1
here,	1
my	1
good	1
sir?	1
You	1
had	1
better	1
neglect	1
your	1
relations	1
than	1
run	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
offending	1
your	1
patroness."	1
"My	1
dear	1
sir,"	1
replied	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
"I	1
am	1
particularly	1
obliged	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
this	1
friendly	1
caution,	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
my	1
not	1
taking	1
so	1
material	1
a	1
step	1
without	1
her	1
ladyship's	1
concurrence."	1
"You	1
cannot	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
upon	1
your	1
guard.	1
Risk	1
anything	1
rather	1
than	1
her	1
displeasure;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
find	1
it	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
raised	1
by	1
your	1
coming	1
to	1
us	1
again,	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
exceedingly	1
probable,	1
stay	1
quietly	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
be	1
satisfied	1
that	1
_we_	1
shall	1
take	1
no	1
offence."	1
"Believe	1
me,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,	1
my	1
gratitude	1
is	1
warmly	1
excited	1
by	1
such	1
affectionate	1
attention;	1
and	1
depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
you	1
will	1
speedily	1
receive	1
from	1
me	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
thanks	1
for	1
this,	1
and	1
for	1
every	1
other	1
mark	1
of	1
your	1
regard	1
during	1
my	1
stay	1
in	1
Hertfordshire.	1
As	1
for	1
my	1
fair	1
cousins,	1
though	1
my	1
absence	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
render	1
it	1
necessary,	1
I	1
shall	1
now	1
take	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
wishing	1
them	1
health	1
and	1
happiness,	1
not	1
excepting	1
my	1
cousin	1
Elizabeth."	1
With	1
proper	1
civilities	1
the	1
ladies	1
then	1
withdrew;	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
equally	1
surprised	1
that	1
he	1
meditated	1
a	1
quick	1
return.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
wished	1
to	1
understand	1
by	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
paying	1
his	1
addresses	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
younger	1
girls,	1
and	1
Mary	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
accept	1
him.	1
She	1
rated	1
his	1
abilities	1
much	1
higher	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
others;	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
solidity	1
in	1
his	1
reflections	1
which	1
often	1
struck	1
her,	1
and	1
though	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
so	1
clever	1
as	1
herself,	1
she	1
thought	1
that	1
if	1
encouraged	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
improve	1
himself	1
by	1
such	1
an	1
example	1
as	1
hers,	1
he	1
might	1
become	1
a	1
very	1
agreeable	1
companion.	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
following	1
morning,	1
every	1
hope	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
was	1
done	1
away.	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
called	1
soon	1
after	1
breakfast,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
private	1
conference	1
with	1
Elizabeth	1
related	1
the	1
event	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
before.	1
The	1
possibility	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
fancying	1
himself	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
friend	1
had	1
once	1
occurred	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
within	1
the	1
last	1
day	1
or	1
two;	1
but	1
that	1
Charlotte	1
could	1
encourage	1
him	1
seemed	1
almost	1
as	1
far	1
from	1
possibility	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
encourage	1
him	1
herself,	1
and	1
her	1
astonishment	1
was	1
consequently	1
so	1
great	1
as	1
to	1
overcome	1
at	1
first	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
decorum,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
crying	1
out:	1
"Engaged	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Collins!	1
My	1
dear	1
Charlotte--impossible!"	1
The	1
steady	1
countenance	1
which	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
had	1
commanded	1
in	1
telling	1
her	1
story,	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
a	1
momentary	1
confusion	1
here	1
on	1
receiving	1
so	1
direct	1
a	1
reproach;	1
though,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
expected,	1
she	1
soon	1
regained	1
her	1
composure,	1
and	1
calmly	1
replied:	1
"Why	1
should	1
you	1
be	1
surprised,	1
my	1
dear	1
Eliza?	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
incredible	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
should	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
procure	1
any	1
woman's	1
good	1
opinion,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
happy	1
as	1
to	1
succeed	1
with	1
you?"	1
But	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
now	1
recollected	1
herself,	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
strong	1
effort	1
for	1
it,	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
assure	1
with	1
tolerable	1
firmness	1
that	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
their	1
relationship	1
was	1
highly	1
grateful	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
wished	1
her	1
all	1
imaginable	1
happiness.	1
"I	1
see	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
feeling,"	1
replied	1
Charlotte.	1
"You	1
must	1
be	1
surprised,	1
very	1
much	1
surprised--so	1
lately	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
was	1
wishing	1
to	1
marry	1
you.	1
But	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
over,	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
done.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
romantic,	1
you	1
know;	1
I	1
never	1
was.	1
I	1
ask	1
only	1
a	1
comfortable	1
home;	1
and	1
considering	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
character,	1
connection,	1
and	1
situation	1
in	1
life,	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
my	1
chance	1
of	1
happiness	1
with	1
him	1
is	1
as	1
fair	1
as	1
most	1
people	1
can	1
boast	1
on	1
entering	1
the	1
marriage	1
state."	1
Elizabeth	1
quietly	1
answered	1
"Undoubtedly;"	1
and	1
after	1
an	1
awkward	1
pause,	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family.	1
Charlotte	1
did	1
not	1
stay	1
much	1
longer,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
then	1
left	1
to	1
reflect	1
on	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
heard.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
before	1
she	1
became	1
at	1
all	1
reconciled	1
to	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
so	1
unsuitable	1
a	1
match.	1
The	1
strangeness	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
making	1
two	1
offers	1
of	1
marriage	1
within	1
three	1
days	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
now	1
accepted.	1
She	1
had	1
always	1
felt	1
that	1
Charlotte's	1
opinion	1
of	1
matrimony	1
was	1
not	1
exactly	1
like	1
her	1
own,	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
supposed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
possible	1
that,	1
when	1
called	1
into	1
action,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
sacrificed	1
every	1
better	1
feeling	1
to	1
worldly	1
advantage.	1
Charlotte	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
humiliating	1
picture!	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
pang	1
of	1
a	1
friend	1
disgracing	1
herself	1
and	1
sunk	1
in	1
her	1
esteem,	1
was	1
added	1
the	1
distressing	1
conviction	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
that	1
friend	1
to	1
be	1
tolerably	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
lot	1
she	1
had	1
chosen.	1
Chapter	1
23	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
sisters,	1
reflecting	1
on	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
heard,	1
and	1
doubting	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
authorised	1
to	1
mention	1
it,	1
when	1
Sir	1
William	1
Lucas	1
himself	1
appeared,	1
sent	1
by	1
his	1
daughter,	1
to	1
announce	1
her	1
engagement	1
to	1
the	1
family.	1
With	1
many	1
compliments	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
much	1
self-gratulation	1
on	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
a	1
connection	1
between	1
the	1
houses,	1
he	1
unfolded	1
the	1
matter--to	1
an	1
audience	1
not	1
merely	1
wondering,	1
but	1
incredulous;	1
for	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
with	1
more	1
perseverance	1
than	1
politeness,	1
protested	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
entirely	1
mistaken;	1
and	1
Lydia,	1
always	1
unguarded	1
and	1
often	1
uncivil,	1
boisterously	1
exclaimed:	1
"Good	1
Lord!	1
Sir	1
William,	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
tell	1
such	1
a	1
story?	1
Do	1
not	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
wants	1
to	1
marry	1
Lizzy?"	1
Nothing	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
complaisance	1
of	1
a	1
courtier	1
could	1
have	1
borne	1
without	1
anger	1
such	1
treatment;	1
but	1
Sir	1
William's	1
good	1
breeding	1
carried	1
him	1
through	1
it	1
all;	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
begged	1
leave	1
to	1
be	1
positive	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
his	1
information,	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
all	1
their	1
impertinence	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
forbearing	1
courtesy.	1
Elizabeth,	1
feeling	1
it	1
incumbent	1
on	1
her	1
to	1
relieve	1
him	1
from	1
so	1
unpleasant	1
a	1
situation,	1
now	1
put	1
herself	1
forward	1
to	1
confirm	1
his	1
account,	1
by	1
mentioning	1
her	1
prior	1
knowledge	1
of	1
it	1
from	1
Charlotte	1
herself;	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
the	1
exclamations	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
sisters	1
by	1
the	1
earnestness	1
of	1
her	1
congratulations	1
to	1
Sir	1
William,	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
readily	1
joined	1
by	1
Jane,	1
and	1
by	1
making	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
remarks	1
on	1
the	1
happiness	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
expected	1
from	1
the	1
match,	1
the	1
excellent	1
character	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
and	1
the	1
convenient	1
distance	1
of	1
Hunsford	1
from	1
London.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
in	1
fact	1
too	1
much	1
overpowered	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
while	1
Sir	1
William	1
remained;	1
but	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
he	1
left	1
them	1
than	1
her	1
feelings	1
found	1
a	1
rapid	1
vent.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
she	1
persisted	1
in	1
disbelieving	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
matter;	1
secondly,	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
sure	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
in;	1
thirdly,	1
she	1
trusted	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
never	1
be	1
happy	1
together;	1
and	1
fourthly,	1
that	1
the	1
match	1
might	1
be	1
broken	1
off.	1
Two	1
inferences,	1
however,	1
were	1
plainly	1
deduced	1
from	1
the	1
whole:	1
one,	1
that	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
the	1
real	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
mischief;	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
that	1
she	1
herself	1
had	1
been	1
barbarously	1
misused	1
by	1
them	1
all;	1
and	1
on	1
these	1
two	1
points	1
she	1
principally	1
dwelt	1
during	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
Nothing	1
could	1
console	1
and	1
nothing	1
could	1
appease	1
her.	1
Nor	1
did	1
that	1
day	1
wear	1
out	1
her	1
resentment.	1
A	1
week	1
elapsed	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
Elizabeth	1
without	1
scolding	1
her,	1
a	1
month	1
passed	1
away	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
speak	1
to	1
Sir	1
William	1
or	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
without	1
being	1
rude,	1
and	1
many	1
months	1
were	1
gone	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
at	1
all	1
forgive	1
their	1
daughter.	1
Mr.	1
Bennet's	1
emotions	1
were	1
much	1
more	1
tranquil	1
on	1
the	1
occasion,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
experience	1
he	1
pronounced	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
agreeable	1
sort;	1
for	1
it	1
gratified	1
him,	1
he	1
said,	1
to	1
discover	1
that	1
Charlotte	1
Lucas,	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
think	1
tolerably	1
sensible,	1
was	1
as	1
foolish	1
as	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
more	1
foolish	1
than	1
his	1
daughter!	1
Jane	1
confessed	1
herself	1
a	1
little	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
match;	1
but	1
she	1
said	1
less	1
of	1
her	1
astonishment	1
than	1
of	1
her	1
earnest	1
desire	1
for	1
their	1
happiness;	1
nor	1
could	1
Elizabeth	1
persuade	1
her	1
to	1
consider	1
it	1
as	1
improbable.	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Lydia	1
were	1
far	1
from	1
envying	1
Miss	1
Lucas,	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
clergyman;	1
and	1
it	1
affected	1
them	1
in	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
than	1
as	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
news	1
to	1
spread	1
at	1
Meryton.	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
insensible	1
of	1
triumph	1
on	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
retort	1
on	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
having	1
a	1
daughter	1
well	1
married;	1
and	1
she	1
called	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
rather	1
oftener	1
than	1
usual	1
to	1
say	1
how	1
happy	1
she	1
was,	1
though	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet's	1
sour	1
looks	1
and	1
ill-natured	1
remarks	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
enough	1
to	1
drive	1
happiness	1
away.	1
Between	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
Charlotte	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
restraint	1
which	1
kept	1
them	1
mutually	1
silent	1
on	1
the	1
subject;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
persuaded	1
that	1
no	1
real	1
confidence	1
could	1
ever	1
subsist	1
between	1
them	1
again.	1
Her	1
disappointment	1
in	1
Charlotte	1
made	1
her	1
turn	1
with	1
fonder	1
regard	1
to	1
her	1
sister,	1
of	1
whose	1
rectitude	1
and	1
delicacy	1
she	1
was	1
sure	1
her	1
opinion	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
shaken,	1
and	1
for	1
whose	1
happiness	1
she	1
grew	1
daily	1
more	1
anxious,	1
as	1
Bingley	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
gone	1
a	1
week	1
and	1
nothing	1
more	1
was	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
return.	1
Jane	1
had	1
sent	1
Caroline	1
an	1
early	1
answer	1
to	1
her	1
letter,	1
and	1
was	1
counting	1
the	1
days	1
till	1
she	1
might	1
reasonably	1
hope	1
to	1
hear	1
again.	1
The	1
promised	1
letter	1
of	1
thanks	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
arrived	1
on	1
Tuesday,	1
addressed	1
to	1
their	1
father,	1
and	1
written	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
solemnity	1
of	1
gratitude	1
which	1
a	1
twelvemonth's	1
abode	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
might	1
have	1
prompted.	1
After	1
discharging	1
his	1
conscience	1
on	1
that	1
head,	1
he	1
proceeded	1
to	1
inform	1
them,	1
with	1
many	1
rapturous	1
expressions,	1
of	1
his	1
happiness	1
in	1
having	1
obtained	1
the	1
affection	1
of	1
their	1
amiable	1
neighbour,	1
Miss	1
Lucas,	1
and	1
then	1
explained	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
merely	1
with	1
the	1
view	1
of	1
enjoying	1
her	1
society	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
ready	1
to	1
close	1
with	1
their	1
kind	1
wish	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
again	1
at	1
Longbourn,	1
whither	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
return	1
on	1
Monday	1
fortnight;	1
for	1
Lady	1
Catherine,	1
he	1
added,	1
so	1
heartily	1
approved	1
his	1
marriage,	1
that	1
she	1
wished	1
it	1
to	1
take	1
place	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible,	1
which	1
he	1
trusted	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
unanswerable	1
argument	1
with	1
his	1
amiable	1
Charlotte	1
to	1
name	1
an	1
early	1
day	1
for	1
making	1
him	1
the	1
happiest	1
of	1
men.	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
return	1
into	1
Hertfordshire	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
pleasure	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
disposed	1
to	1
complain	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
her	1
husband.	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
strange	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
Longbourn	1
instead	1
of	1
to	1
Lucas	1
Lodge;	1
it	1
was	1
also	1
very	1
inconvenient	1
and	1
exceedingly	1
troublesome.	1
She	1
hated	1
having	1
visitors	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
while	1
her	1
health	1
was	1
so	1
indifferent,	1
and	1
lovers	1
were	1
of	1
all	1
people	1
the	1
most	1
disagreeable.	1
Such	1
were	1
the	1
gentle	1
murmurs	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
and	1
they	1
gave	1
way	1
only	1
to	1
the	1
greater	1
distress	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
continued	1
absence.	1
Neither	1
Jane	1
nor	1
Elizabeth	1
were	1
comfortable	1
on	1
this	1
subject.	1
Day	1
after	1
day	1
passed	1
away	1
without	1
bringing	1
any	1
other	1
tidings	1
of	1
him	1
than	1
the	1
report	1
which	1
shortly	1
prevailed	1
in	1
Meryton	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
Netherfield	1
the	1
whole	1
winter;	1
a	1
report	1
which	1
highly	1
incensed	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
and	1
which	1
she	1
never	1
failed	1
to	1
contradict	1
as	1
a	1
most	1
scandalous	1
falsehood.	1
Even	1
Elizabeth	1
began	1
to	1
fear--not	1
that	1
Bingley	1
was	1
indifferent--but	1
that	1
his	1
sisters	1
would	1
be	1
successful	1
in	1
keeping	1
him	1
away.	1
Unwilling	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
admit	1
an	1
idea	1
so	1
destructive	1
of	1
Jane's	1
happiness,	1
and	1
so	1
dishonorable	1
to	1
the	1
stability	1
of	1
her	1
lover,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
prevent	1
its	1
frequently	1
occurring.	1
The	1
united	1
efforts	1
of	1
his	1
two	1
unfeeling	1
sisters	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
overpowering	1
friend,	1
assisted	1
by	1
the	1
attractions	1
of	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
and	1
the	1
amusements	1
of	1
London	1
might	1
be	1
too	1
much,	1
she	1
feared,	1
for	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
his	1
attachment.	1
As	1
for	1
Jane,	1
_her_	1
anxiety	1
under	1
this	1
suspense	1
was,	1
of	1
course,	1
more	1
painful	1
than	1
Elizabeth's,	1
but	1
whatever	1
she	1
felt	1
she	1
was	1
desirous	1
of	1
concealing,	1
and	1
between	1
herself	1
and	1
Elizabeth,	1
therefore,	1
the	1
subject	1
was	1
never	1
alluded	1
to.	1
But	1
as	1
no	1
such	1
delicacy	1
restrained	1
her	1
mother,	1
an	1
hour	1
seldom	1
passed	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
talk	1
of	1
Bingley,	1
express	1
her	1
impatience	1
for	1
his	1
arrival,	1
or	1
even	1
require	1
Jane	1
to	1
confess	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
back	1
she	1
would	1
think	1
herself	1
very	1
ill	1
used.	1
It	1
needed	1
all	1
Jane's	1
steady	1
mildness	1
to	1
bear	1
these	1
attacks	1
with	1
tolerable	1
tranquillity.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
returned	1
most	1
punctually	1
on	1
Monday	1
fortnight,	1
but	1
his	1
reception	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
gracious	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
his	1
first	1
introduction.	1
He	1
was	1
too	1
happy,	1
however,	1
to	1
need	1
much	1
attention;	1
and	1
luckily	1
for	1
the	1
others,	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
love-making	1
relieved	1
them	1
from	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
his	1
company.	1
The	1
chief	1
of	1
every	1
day	1
was	1
spent	1
by	1
him	1
at	1
Lucas	1
Lodge,	1
and	1
he	1
sometimes	1
returned	1
to	1
Longbourn	1
only	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
apology	1
for	1
his	1
absence	1
before	1
the	1
family	1
went	1
to	1
bed.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
really	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
pitiable	1
state.	1
The	1
very	1
mention	1
of	1
anything	1
concerning	1
the	1
match	1
threw	1
her	1
into	1
an	1
agony	1
of	1
ill-humour,	1
and	1
wherever	1
she	1
went	1
she	1
was	1
sure	1
of	1
hearing	1
it	1
talked	1
of.	1
The	1
sight	1
of	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
was	1
odious	1
to	1
her.	1
As	1
her	1
successor	1
in	1
that	1
house,	1
she	1
regarded	1
her	1
with	1
jealous	1
abhorrence.	1
Whenever	1
Charlotte	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
them,	1
she	1
concluded	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
anticipating	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
possession;	1
and	1
whenever	1
she	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
of	1
the	1
Longbourn	1
estate,	1
and	1
resolving	1
to	1
turn	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
daughters	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
were	1
dead.	1
She	1
complained	1
bitterly	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
to	1
her	1
husband.	1
"Indeed,	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"it	1
is	1
very	1
hard	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
Charlotte	1
Lucas	1
should	1
ever	1
be	1
mistress	1
of	1
this	1
house,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
forced	1
to	1
make	1
way	1
for	1
_her_,	1
and	1
live	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
take	1
her	1
place	1
in	1
it!"	1
"My	1
dear,	1
do	1
not	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
such	1
gloomy	1
thoughts.	1
Let	1
us	1
hope	1
for	1
better	1
things.	1
Let	1
us	1
flatter	1
ourselves	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
survivor."	1
This	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
consoling	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
and	1
therefore,	1
instead	1
of	1
making	1
any	1
answer,	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
as	1
before.	1
"I	1
cannot	1
bear	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
all	1
this	1
estate.	1
If	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
entail,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
mind	1
it."	1
"What	1
should	1
not	1
you	1
mind?"	1
"I	1
should	1
not	1
mind	1
anything	1
at	1
all."	1
"Let	1
us	1
be	1
thankful	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
preserved	1
from	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
such	1
insensibility."	1
"I	1
never	1
can	1
be	1
thankful,	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
for	1
anything	1
about	1
the	1
entail.	1
How	1
anyone	1
could	1
have	1
the	1
conscience	1
to	1
entail	1
away	1
an	1
estate	1
from	1
one's	1
own	1
daughters,	1
I	1
cannot	1
understand;	1
and	1
all	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
too!	1
Why	1
should	1
_he_	1
have	1
it	1
more	1
than	1
anybody	1
else?"	1
"I	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
yourself	1
to	1
determine,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Bennet.	1
Chapter	1
24	1
Miss	1
Bingley's	1
letter	1
arrived,	1
and	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
doubt.	1
The	1
very	1
first	1
sentence	1
conveyed	1
the	1
assurance	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
all	1
settled	1
in	1
London	1
for	1
the	1
winter,	1
and	1
concluded	1
with	1
her	1
brother's	1
regret	1
at	1
not	1
having	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
respects	1
to	1
his	1
friends	1
in	1
Hertfordshire	1
before	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
country.	1
Hope	1
was	1
over,	1
entirely	1
over;	1
and	1
when	1
Jane	1
could	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
letter,	1
she	1
found	1
little,	1
except	1
the	1
professed	1
affection	1
of	1
the	1
writer,	1
that	1
could	1
give	1
her	1
any	1
comfort.	1
Miss	1
Darcy's	1
praise	1
occupied	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
it.	1
Her	1
many	1
attractions	1
were	1
again	1
dwelt	1
on,	1
and	1
Caroline	1
boasted	1
joyfully	1
of	1
their	1
increasing	1
intimacy,	1
and	1
ventured	1
to	1
predict	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
the	1
wishes	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
unfolded	1
in	1
her	1
former	1
letter.	1
She	1
wrote	1
also	1
with	1
great	1
pleasure	1
of	1
her	1
brother's	1
being	1
an	1
inmate	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
house,	1
and	1
mentioned	1
with	1
raptures	1
some	1
plans	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
new	1
furniture.	1
Elizabeth,	1
to	1
whom	1
Jane	1
very	1
soon	1
communicated	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
heard	1
it	1
in	1
silent	1
indignation.	1
Her	1
heart	1
was	1
divided	1
between	1
concern	1
for	1
her	1
sister,	1
and	1
resentment	1
against	1
all	1
others.	1
To	1
Caroline's	1
assertion	1
of	1
her	1
brother's	1
being	1
partial	1
to	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
she	1
paid	1
no	1
credit.	1
That	1
he	1
was	1
really	1
fond	1
of	1
Jane,	1
she	1
doubted	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
done;	1
and	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
disposed	1
to	1
like	1
him,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
without	1
anger,	1
hardly	1
without	1
contempt,	1
on	1
that	1
easiness	1
of	1
temper,	1
that	1
want	1
of	1
proper	1
resolution,	1
which	1
now	1
made	1
him	1
the	1
slave	1
of	1
his	1
designing	1
friends,	1
and	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
happiness	1
to	1
the	1
caprice	1
of	1
their	1
inclination.	1
Had	1
his	1
own	1
happiness,	1
however,	1
been	1
the	1
only	1
sacrifice,	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
allowed	1
to	1
sport	1
with	1
it	1
in	1
whatever	1
manner	1
he	1
thought	1
best,	1
but	1
her	1
sister's	1
was	1
involved	1
in	1
it,	1
as	1
she	1
thought	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
sensible	1
himself.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
subject,	1
in	1
short,	1
on	1
which	1
reflection	1
would	1
be	1
long	1
indulged,	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
unavailing.	1
She	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
else;	1
and	1
yet	1
whether	1
Bingley's	1
regard	1
had	1
really	1
died	1
away,	1
or	1
were	1
suppressed	1
by	1
his	1
friends'	1
interference;	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
aware	1
of	1
Jane's	1
attachment,	1
or	1
whether	1
it	1
had	1
escaped	1
his	1
observation;	1
whatever	1
were	1
the	1
case,	1
though	1
her	1
opinion	1
of	1
him	1
must	1
be	1
materially	1
affected	1
by	1
the	1
difference,	1
her	1
sister's	1
situation	1
remained	1
the	1
same,	1
her	1
peace	1
equally	1
wounded.	1
A	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
passed	1
before	1
Jane	1
had	1
courage	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
her	1
feelings	1
to	1
Elizabeth;	1
but	1
at	1
last,	1
on	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet's	1
leaving	1
them	1
together,	1
after	1
a	1
longer	1
irritation	1
than	1
usual	1
about	1
Netherfield	1
and	1
its	1
master,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
saying:	1
"Oh,	1
that	1
my	1
dear	1
mother	1
had	1
more	1
command	1
over	1
herself!	1
She	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
pain	1
she	1
gives	1
me	1
by	1
her	1
continual	1
reflections	1
on	1
him.	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
repine.	1
It	1
cannot	1
last	1
long.	1
He	1
will	1
be	1
forgot,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
be	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
before."	1
Elizabeth	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
sister	1
with	1
incredulous	1
solicitude,	1
but	1
said	1
nothing.	1
"You	1
doubt	1
me,"	1
cried	1
Jane,	1
slightly	1
colouring;	1
"indeed,	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
reason.	1
He	1
may	1
live	1
in	1
my	1
memory	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
amiable	1
man	1
of	1
my	1
acquaintance,	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
all.	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
either	1
to	1
hope	1
or	1
fear,	1
and	1
nothing	1
to	1
reproach	1
him	1
with.	1
Thank	1
God!	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
_that_	1
pain.	1
A	1
little	1
time,	1
therefore--I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
better."	1
With	1
a	1
stronger	1
voice	1
she	1
soon	1
added,	1
"I	1
have	1
this	1
comfort	1
immediately,	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
more	1
than	1
an	1
error	1
of	1
fancy	1
on	1
my	1
side,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
done	1
no	1
harm	1
to	1
anyone	1
but	1
myself."	1
"My	1
dear	1
Jane!"	1
exclaimed	1
Elizabeth,	1
"you	1
are	1
too	1
good.	1
Your	1
sweetness	1
and	1
disinterestedness	1
are	1
really	1
angelic;	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you.	1
I	1
feel	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
done	1
you	1
justice,	1
or	1
loved	1
you	1
as	1
you	1
deserve."	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
eagerly	1
disclaimed	1
all	1
extraordinary	1
merit,	1
and	1
threw	1
back	1
the	1
praise	1
on	1
her	1
sister's	1
warm	1
affection.	1
"Nay,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
"this	1
is	1
not	1
fair.	1
_You_	1
wish	1
to	1
think	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
respectable,	1
and	1
are	1
hurt	1
if	1
I	1
speak	1
ill	1
of	1
anybody.	1
I	1
only	1
want	1
to	1
think	1
_you_	1
perfect,	1
and	1
you	1
set	1
yourself	1
against	1
it.	1
Do	1
not	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
my	1
running	1
into	1
any	1
excess,	1
of	1
my	1
encroaching	1
on	1
your	1
privilege	1
of	1
universal	1
good-will.	1
You	1
need	1
not.	1
There	1
are	1
few	1
people	1
whom	1
I	1
really	1
love,	1
and	1
still	1
fewer	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
think	1
well.	1
The	1
more	1
I	1
see	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
more	1
am	1
I	1
dissatisfied	1
with	1
it;	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
confirms	1
my	1
belief	1
of	1
the	1
inconsistency	1
of	1
all	1
human	1
characters,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
dependence	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
merit	1
or	1
sense.	1
I	1
have	1
met	1
with	1
two	1
instances	1
lately,	1
one	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
mention;	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
Charlotte's	1
marriage.	1
It	1
is	1
unaccountable!	1
In	1
every	1
view	1
it	1
is	1
unaccountable!"	1
"My	1
dear	1
Lizzy,	1
do	1
not	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
such	1
feelings	1
as	1
these.	1
They	1
will	1
ruin	1
your	1
happiness.	1
You	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
allowance	1
enough	1
for	1
difference	1
of	1
situation	1
and	1
temper.	1
Consider	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
respectability,	1
and	1
Charlotte's	1
steady,	1
prudent	1
character.	1
Remember	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
family;	1
that	1
as	1
to	1
fortune,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
eligible	1
match;	1
and	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
believe,	1
for	1
everybody's	1
sake,	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
feel	1
something	1
like	1
regard	1
and	1
esteem	1
for	1
our	1
cousin."	1
"To	1
oblige	1
you,	1
I	1
would	1
try	1
to	1
believe	1
almost	1
anything,	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
could	1
be	1
benefited	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
belief	1
as	1
this;	1
for	1
were	1
I	1
persuaded	1
that	1
Charlotte	1
had	1
any	1
regard	1
for	1
him,	1
I	1
should	1
only	1
think	1
worse	1
of	1
her	1
understanding	1
than	1
I	1
now	1
do	1
of	1
her	1
heart.	1
My	1
dear	1
Jane,	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
is	1
a	1
conceited,	1
pompous,	1
narrow-minded,	1
silly	1
man;	1
you	1
know	1
he	1
is,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do;	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
feel,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do,	1
that	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
married	1
him	1
cannot	1
have	1
a	1
proper	1
way	1
of	1
thinking.	1
You	1
shall	1
not	1
defend	1
her,	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
Charlotte	1
Lucas.	1
You	1
shall	1
not,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
one	1
individual,	1
change	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
principle	1
and	1
integrity,	1
nor	1
endeavour	1
to	1
persuade	1
yourself	1
or	1
me,	1
that	1
selfishness	1
is	1
prudence,	1
and	1
insensibility	1
of	1
danger	1
security	1
for	1
happiness."	1
"I	1
must	1
think	1
your	1
language	1
too	1
strong	1
in	1
speaking	1
of	1
both,"	1
replied	1
Jane;	1
"and	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
convinced	1
of	1
it	1
by	1
seeing	1
them	1
happy	1
together.	1
But	1
enough	1
of	1
this.	1
You	1
alluded	1
to	1
something	1
else.	1
You	1
mentioned	1
_two_	1
instances.	1
I	1
cannot	1
misunderstand	1
you,	1
but	1
I	1
entreat	1
you,	1
dear	1
Lizzy,	1
not	1
to	1
pain	1
me	1
by	1
thinking	1
_that	1
person_	1
to	1
blame,	1
and	1
saying	1
your	1
opinion	1
of	1
him	1
is	1
sunk.	1
We	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
ready	1
to	1
fancy	1
ourselves	1
intentionally	1
injured.	1
We	1
must	1
not	1
expect	1
a	1
lively	1
young	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
so	1
guarded	1
and	1
circumspect.	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
often	1
nothing	1
but	1
our	1
own	1
vanity	1
that	1
deceives	1
us.	1
Women	1
fancy	1
admiration	1
means	1
more	1
than	1
it	1
does."	1
"And	1
men	1
take	1
care	1
that	1
they	1
should."	1
"If	1
it	1
is	1
designedly	1
done,	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
justified;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
there	1
being	1
so	1
much	1
design	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
as	1
some	1
persons	1
imagine."	1
"I	1
am	1
far	1
from	1
attributing	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
conduct	1
to	1
design,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth;	1
"but	1
without	1
scheming	1
to	1
do	1
wrong,	1
or	1
to	1
make	1
others	1
unhappy,	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
error,	1
and	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
misery.	1
Thoughtlessness,	1
want	1
of	1
attention	1
to	1
other	1
people's	1
feelings,	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
resolution,	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
business."	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
impute	1
it	1
to	1
either	1
of	1
those?"	1
"Yes;	1
to	1
the	1
last.	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
go	1
on,	1
I	1
shall	1
displease	1
you	1
by	1
saying	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
persons	1
you	1
esteem.	1
Stop	1
me	1
whilst	1
you	1
can."	1
"You	1
persist,	1
then,	1
in	1
supposing	1
his	1
sisters	1
influence	1
him?"	1
"Yes,	1
in	1
conjunction	1
with	1
his	1
friend."	1
"I	1
cannot	1
believe	1
it.	1
Why	1
should	1
they	1
try	1
to	1
influence	1
him?	1
They	1
can	1
only	1
wish	1
his	1
happiness;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
attached	1
to	1
me,	1
no	1
other	1
woman	1
can	1
secure	1
it."	1
"Your	1
first	1
position	1
is	1
false.	1
They	1
may	1
wish	1
many	1
things	1
besides	1
his	1
happiness;	1
they	1
may	1
wish	1
his	1
increase	1
of	1
wealth	1
and	1
consequence;	1
they	1
may	1
wish	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
a	1
girl	1
who	1
has	1
all	1
the	1
importance	1
of	1
money,	1
great	1
connections,	1
and	1
pride."	1
"Beyond	1
a	1
doubt,	1
they	1
_do_	1
wish	1
him	1
to	1
choose	1
Miss	1
Darcy,"	1
replied	1
Jane;	1
"but	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
from	1
better	1
feelings	1
than	1
you	1
are	1
supposing.	1
They	1
have	1
known	1
her	1
much	1
longer	1
than	1
they	1
have	1
known	1
me;	1
no	1
wonder	1
if	1
they	1
love	1
her	1
better.	1
But,	1
whatever	1
may	1
be	1
their	1
own	1
wishes,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
unlikely	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
opposed	1
their	1
brother's.	1
What	1
sister	1
would	1
think	1
herself	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
do	1
it,	1
unless	1
there	1
were	1
something	1
very	1
objectionable?	1
If	1
they	1
believed	1
him	1
attached	1
to	1
me,	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
try	1
to	1
part	1
us;	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
so,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
succeed.	1
By	1
supposing	1
such	1
an	1
affection,	1
you	1
make	1
everybody	1
acting	1
unnaturally	1
and	1
wrong,	1
and	1
me	1
most	1
unhappy.	1
Do	1
not	1
distress	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
idea.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
ashamed	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
mistaken--or,	1
at	1
least,	1
it	1
is	1
light,	1
it	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
feel	1
in	1
thinking	1
ill	1
of	1
him	1
or	1
his	1
sisters.	1
Let	1
me	1
take	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
light,	1
in	1
the	1
light	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
understood."	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
oppose	1
such	1
a	1
wish;	1
and	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
name	1
was	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
mentioned	1
between	1
them.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
still	1
continued	1
to	1
wonder	1
and	1
repine	1
at	1
his	1
returning	1
no	1
more,	1
and	1
though	1
a	1
day	1
seldom	1
passed	1
in	1
which	1
Elizabeth	1
did	1
not	1
account	1
for	1
it	1
clearly,	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
chance	1
of	1
her	1
ever	1
considering	1
it	1
with	1
less	1
perplexity.	1
Her	1
daughter	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
convince	1
her	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
herself,	1
that	1
his	1
attentions	1
to	1
Jane	1
had	1
been	1
merely	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
a	1
common	1
and	1
transient	1
liking,	1
which	1
ceased	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
her	1
no	1
more;	1
but	1
though	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
the	1
statement	1
was	1
admitted	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
story	1
to	1
repeat	1
every	1
day.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet's	1
best	1
comfort	1
was	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
must	1
be	1
down	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
summer.	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
treated	1
the	1
matter	1
differently.	1
"So,	1
Lizzy,"	1
said	1
he	1
one	1
day,	1
"your	1
sister	1
is	1
crossed	1
in	1
love,	1
I	1
find.	1
I	1
congratulate	1
her.	1
Next	1
to	1
being	1
married,	1
a	1
girl	1
likes	1
to	1
be	1
crossed	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
love	1
now	1
and	1
then.	1
It	1
is	1
something	1
to	1
think	1
of,	1
and	1
it	1
gives	1
her	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
distinction	1
among	1
her	1
companions.	1
When	1
is	1
your	1
turn	1
to	1
come?	1
You	1
will	1
hardly	1
bear	1
to	1
be	1
long	1
outdone	1
by	1
Jane.	1
Now	1
is	1
your	1
time.	1
Here	1
are	1
officers	1
enough	1
in	1
Meryton	1
to	1
disappoint	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
Let	1
Wickham	1
be	1
_your_	1
man.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
pleasant	1
fellow,	1
and	1
would	1
jilt	1
you	1
creditably."	1
"Thank	1
you,	1
sir,	1
but	1
a	1
less	1
agreeable	1
man	1
would	1
satisfy	1
me.	1
We	1
must	1
not	1
all	1
expect	1
Jane's	1
good	1
fortune."	1
"True,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
comfort	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
whatever	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
may	1
befall	1
you,	1
you	1
have	1
an	1
affectionate	1
mother	1
who	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
it."	1
Mr.	1
Wickham's	1
society	1
was	1
of	1
material	1
service	1
in	1
dispelling	1
the	1
gloom	1
which	1
the	1
late	1
perverse	1
occurrences	1
had	1
thrown	1
on	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Longbourn	1
family.	1
They	1
saw	1
him	1
often,	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
other	1
recommendations	1
was	1
now	1
added	1
that	1
of	1
general	1
unreserve.	1
The	1
whole	1
of	1
what	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
already	1
heard,	1
his	1
claims	1
on	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
from	1
him,	1
was	1
now	1
openly	1
acknowledged	1
and	1
publicly	1
canvassed;	1
and	1
everybody	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
they	1
had	1
always	1
disliked	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
before	1
they	1
had	1
known	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
creature	1
who	1
could	1
suppose	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
any	1
extenuating	1
circumstances	1
in	1
the	1
case,	1
unknown	1
to	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
Hertfordshire;	1
her	1
mild	1
and	1
steady	1
candour	1
always	1
pleaded	1
for	1
allowances,	1
and	1
urged	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
mistakes--but	1
by	1
everybody	1
else	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
was	1
condemned	1
as	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
men.	1
Chapter	1
25	1
After	1
a	1
week	1
spent	1
in	1
professions	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
schemes	1
of	1
felicity,	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
was	1
called	1
from	1
his	1
amiable	1
Charlotte	1
by	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
Saturday.	1
The	1
pain	1
of	1
separation,	1
however,	1
might	1
be	1
alleviated	1
on	1
his	1
side,	1
by	1
preparations	1
for	1
the	1
reception	1
of	1
his	1
bride;	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
reason	1
to	1
hope,	1
that	1
shortly	1
after	1
his	1
return	1
into	1
Hertfordshire,	1
the	1
day	1
would	1
be	1
fixed	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
the	1
happiest	1
of	1
men.	1
He	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
his	1
relations	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
solemnity	1
as	1
before;	1
wished	1
his	1
fair	1
cousins	1
health	1
and	1
happiness	1
again,	1
and	1
promised	1
their	1
father	1
another	1
letter	1
of	1
thanks.	1
On	1
the	1
following	1
Monday,	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
receiving	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
who	1
came	1
as	1
usual	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
Christmas	1
at	1
Longbourn.	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
was	1
a	1
sensible,	1
gentlemanlike	1
man,	1
greatly	1
superior	1
to	1
his	1
sister,	1
as	1
well	1
by	1
nature	1
as	1
education.	1
The	1
Netherfield	1
ladies	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
difficulty	1
in	1
believing	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
lived	1
by	1
trade,	1
and	1
within	1
view	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
warehouses,	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
well-bred	1
and	1
agreeable.	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
who	1
was	1
several	1
years	1
younger	1
than	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips,	1
was	1
an	1
amiable,	1
intelligent,	1
elegant	1
woman,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
favourite	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
Longbourn	1
nieces.	1
Between	1
the	1
two	1
eldest	1
and	1
herself	1
especially,	1
there	1
subsisted	1
a	1
particular	1
regard.	1
They	1
had	1
frequently	1
been	1
staying	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
town.	1
The	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner's	1
business	1
on	1
her	1
arrival	1
was	1
to	1
distribute	1
her	1
presents	1
and	1
describe	1
the	1
newest	1
fashions.	1
When	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
less	1
active	1
part	1
to	1
play.	1
It	1
became	1
her	1
turn	1
to	1
listen.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
had	1
many	1
grievances	1
to	1
relate,	1
and	1
much	1
to	1
complain	1
of.	1
They	1
had	1
all	1
been	1
very	1
ill-used	1
since	1
she	1
last	1
saw	1
her	1
sister.	1
Two	1
of	1
her	1
girls	1
had	1
been	1
upon	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
marriage,	1
and	1
after	1
all	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
it.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
blame	1
Jane,"	1
she	1
continued,	1
"for	1
Jane	1
would	1
have	1
got	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
if	1
she	1
could.	1
But	1
Lizzy!	1
Oh,	1
sister!	1
It	1
is	1
very	1
hard	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
wife	1
by	1
this	1
time,	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
perverseness.	1
He	1
made	1
her	1
an	1
offer	1
in	1
this	1
very	1
room,	1
and	1
she	1
refused	1
him.	1
The	1
consequence	1
of	1
it	1
is,	1
that	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
daughter	1
married	1
before	1
I	1
have,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Longbourn	1
estate	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
entailed	1
as	1
ever.	1
The	1
Lucases	1
are	1
very	1
artful	1
people	1
indeed,	1
sister.	1
They	1
are	1
all	1
for	1
what	1
they	1
can	1
get.	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
of	1
them,	1
but	1
so	1
it	1
is.	1
It	1
makes	1
me	1
very	1
nervous	1
and	1
poorly,	1
to	1
be	1
thwarted	1
so	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
family,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
neighbours	1
who	1
think	1
of	1
themselves	1
before	1
anybody	1
else.	1
However,	1
your	1
coming	1
just	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
comforts,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
you	1
tell	1
us,	1
of	1
long	1
sleeves."	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
this	1
news	1
had	1
been	1
given	1
before,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
Jane	1
and	1
Elizabeth's	1
correspondence	1
with	1
her,	1
made	1
her	1
sister	1
a	1
slight	1
answer,	1
and,	1
in	1
compassion	1
to	1
her	1
nieces,	1
turned	1
the	1
conversation.	1
When	1
alone	1
with	1
Elizabeth	1
afterwards,	1
she	1
spoke	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
"It	1
seems	1
likely	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
desirable	1
match	1
for	1
Jane,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry	1
it	1
went	1
off.	1
But	1
these	1
things	1
happen	1
so	1
often!	1
A	1
young	1
man,	1
such	1
as	1
you	1
describe	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
so	1
easily	1
falls	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
a	1
pretty	1
girl	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
weeks,	1
and	1
when	1
accident	1
separates	1
them,	1
so	1
easily	1
forgets	1
her,	1
that	1
these	1
sort	1
of	1
inconsistencies	1
are	1
very	1
frequent."	1
"An	1
excellent	1
consolation	1
in	1
its	1
way,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
"but	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
for	1
_us_.	1
We	1
do	1
not	1
suffer	1
by	1
_accident_.	1
It	1
does	1
not	1
often	1
happen	1
that	1
the	1
interference	1
of	1
friends	1
will	1
persuade	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
independent	1
fortune	1
to	1
think	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
girl	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
violently	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before."	1
"But	1
that	1
expression	1
of	1
'violently	1
in	1
love'	1
is	1
so	1
hackneyed,	1
so	1
doubtful,	1
so	1
indefinite,	1
that	1
it	1
gives	1
me	1
very	1
little	1
idea.	1
It	1
is	1
as	1
often	1
applied	1
to	1
feelings	1
which	1
arise	1
from	1
a	1
half-hour's	1
acquaintance,	1
as	1
to	1
a	1
real,	1
strong	1
attachment.	1
Pray,	1
how	1
_violent	1
was_	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
love?"	1
"I	1
never	1
saw	1
a	1
more	1
promising	1
inclination;	1
he	1
was	1
growing	1
quite	1
inattentive	1
to	1
other	1
people,	1
and	1
wholly	1
engrossed	1
by	1
her.	1
Every	1
time	1
they	1
met,	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
decided	1
and	1
remarkable.	1
At	1
his	1
own	1
ball	1
he	1
offended	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
young	1
ladies,	1
by	1
not	1
asking	1
them	1
to	1
dance;	1
and	1
I	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
twice	1
myself,	1
without	1
receiving	1
an	1
answer.	1
Could	1
there	1
be	1
finer	1
symptoms?	1
Is	1
not	1
general	1
incivility	1
the	1
very	1
essence	1
of	1
love?"	1
"Oh,	1
yes!--of	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
love	1
which	1
I	1
suppose	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
felt.	1
Poor	1
Jane!	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
her,	1
because,	1
with	1
her	1
disposition,	1
she	1
may	1
not	1
get	1
over	1
it	1
immediately.	1
It	1
had	1
better	1
have	1
happened	1
to	1
_you_,	1
Lizzy;	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
laughed	1
yourself	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
sooner.	1
But	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
prevailed	1
upon	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
with	1
us?	1
Change	1
of	1
scene	1
might	1
be	1
of	1
service--and	1
perhaps	1
a	1
little	1
relief	1
from	1
home	1
may	1
be	1
as	1
useful	1
as	1
anything."	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
pleased	1
with	1
this	1
proposal,	1
and	1
felt	1
persuaded	1
of	1
her	1
sister's	1
ready	1
acquiescence.	1
"I	1
hope,"	1
added	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
"that	1
no	1
consideration	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
will	1
influence	1
her.	1
We	1
live	1
in	1
so	1
different	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
town,	1
all	1
our	1
connections	1
are	1
so	1
different,	1
and,	1
as	1
you	1
well	1
know,	1
we	1
go	1
out	1
so	1
little,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
improbable	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
meet	1
at	1
all,	1
unless	1
he	1
really	1
comes	1
to	1
see	1
her."	1
"And	1
_that_	1
is	1
quite	1
impossible;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
the	1
custody	1
of	1
his	1
friend,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
would	1
no	1
more	1
suffer	1
him	1
to	1
call	1
on	1
Jane	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
London!	1
My	1
dear	1
aunt,	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
it?	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
may	1
perhaps	1
have	1
_heard_	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
place	1
as	1
Gracechurch	1
Street,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
hardly	1
think	1
a	1
month's	1
ablution	1
enough	1
to	1
cleanse	1
him	1
from	1
its	1
impurities,	1
were	1
he	1
once	1
to	1
enter	1
it;	1
and	1
depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
never	1
stirs	1
without	1
him."	1
"So	1
much	1
the	1
better.	1
I	1
hope	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
meet	1
at	1
all.	1
But	1
does	1
not	1
Jane	1
correspond	1
with	1
his	1
sister?	1
_She_	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
help	1
calling."	1
"She	1
will	1
drop	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
entirely."	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
certainty	1
in	1
which	1
Elizabeth	1
affected	1
to	1
place	1
this	1
point,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
still	1
more	1
interesting	1
one	1
of	1
Bingley's	1
being	1
withheld	1
from	1
seeing	1
Jane,	1
she	1
felt	1
a	1
solicitude	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
which	1
convinced	1
her,	1
on	1
examination,	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
it	1
entirely	1
hopeless.	1
It	1
was	1
possible,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
probable,	1
that	1
his	1
affection	1
might	1
be	1
reanimated,	1
and	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
his	1
friends	1
successfully	1
combated	1
by	1
the	1
more	1
natural	1
influence	1
of	1
Jane's	1
attractions.	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
accepted	1
her	1
aunt's	1
invitation	1
with	1
pleasure;	1
and	1
the	1
Bingleys	1
were	1
no	1
otherwise	1
in	1
her	1
thoughts	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
than	1
as	1
she	1
hoped	1
by	1
Caroline's	1
not	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
with	1
her	1
brother,	1
she	1
might	1
occasionally	1
spend	1
a	1
morning	1
with	1
her,	1
without	1
any	1
danger	1
of	1
seeing	1
him.	1
The	1
Gardiners	1
stayed	1
a	1
week	1
at	1
Longbourn;	1
and	1
what	1
with	1
the	1
Phillipses,	1
the	1
Lucases,	1
and	1
the	1
officers,	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
day	1
without	1
its	1
engagement.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
had	1
so	1
carefully	1
provided	1
for	1
the	1
entertainment	1
of	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
sister,	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
family	1
dinner.	1
When	1
the	1
engagement	1
was	1
for	1
home,	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
always	1
made	1
part	1
of	1
it--of	1
which	1
officers	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
was	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
one;	1
and	1
on	1
these	1
occasions,	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
rendered	1
suspicious	1
by	1
Elizabeth's	1
warm	1
commendation,	1
narrowly	1
observed	1
them	1
both.	1
Without	1
supposing	1
them,	1
from	1
what	1
she	1
saw,	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
seriously	1
in	1
love,	1
their	1
preference	1
of	1
each	1
other	1
was	1
plain	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
a	1
little	1
uneasy;	1
and	1
she	1
resolved	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
before	1
she	1
left	1
Hertfordshire,	1
and	1
represent	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
imprudence	1
of	1
encouraging	1
such	1
an	1
attachment.	1
To	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
Wickham	1
had	1
one	1
means	1
of	1
affording	1
pleasure,	1
unconnected	1
with	1
his	1
general	1
powers.	1
About	1
ten	1
or	1
a	1
dozen	1
years	1
ago,	1
before	1
her	1
marriage,	1
she	1
had	1
spent	1
a	1
considerable	1
time	1
in	1
that	1
very	1
part	1
of	1
Derbyshire	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
belonged.	1
They	1
had,	1
therefore,	1
many	1
acquaintances	1
in	1
common;	1
and	1
though	1
Wickham	1
had	1
been	1
little	1
there	1
since	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Darcy's	1
father,	1
it	1
was	1
yet	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
fresher	1
intelligence	1
of	1
her	1
former	1
friends	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
procuring.	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
had	1
seen	1
Pemberley,	1
and	1
known	1
the	1
late	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
by	1
character	1
perfectly	1
well.	1
Here	1
consequently	1
was	1
an	1
inexhaustible	1
subject	1
of	1
discourse.	1
In	1
comparing	1
her	1
recollection	1
of	1
Pemberley	1
with	1
the	1
minute	1
description	1
which	1
Wickham	1
could	1
give,	1
and	1
in	1
bestowing	1
her	1
tribute	1
of	1
praise	1
on	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
its	1
late	1
possessor,	1
she	1
was	1
delighting	1
both	1
him	1
and	1
herself.	1
On	1
being	1
made	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
present	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
treatment	1
of	1
him,	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
remember	1
some	1
of	1
that	1
gentleman's	1
reputed	1
disposition	1
when	1
quite	1
a	1
lad	1
which	1
might	1
agree	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
was	1
confident	1
at	1
last	1
that	1
she	1
recollected	1
having	1
heard	1
Mr.	1
Fitzwilliam	1
Darcy	1
formerly	1
spoken	1
of	1
as	1
a	1
very	1
proud,	1
ill-natured	1
boy.	1
Chapter	1
26	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner's	1
caution	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
punctually	1
and	1
kindly	1
given	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
favourable	1
opportunity	1
of	1
speaking	1
to	1
her	1
alone;	1
after	1
honestly	1
telling	1
her	1
what	1
she	1
thought,	1
she	1
thus	1
went	1
on:	1
"You	1
are	1
too	1
sensible	1
a	1
girl,	1
Lizzy,	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
merely	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
warned	1
against	1
it;	1
and,	1
therefore,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
speaking	1
openly.	1
Seriously,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
be	1
on	1
your	1
guard.	1
Do	1
not	1
involve	1
yourself	1
or	1
endeavour	1
to	1
involve	1
him	1
in	1
an	1
affection	1
which	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
fortune	1
would	1
make	1
so	1
very	1
imprudent.	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
against	1
_him_;	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
interesting	1
young	1
man;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
fortune	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
have,	1
I	1
should	1
think	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
better.	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
let	1
your	1
fancy	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
you.	1
You	1
have	1
sense,	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
expect	1
you	1
to	1
use	1
it.	1
Your	1
father	1
would	1
depend	1
on	1
_your_	1
resolution	1
and	1
good	1
conduct,	1
I	1
am	1
sure.	1
You	1
must	1
not	1
disappoint	1
your	1
father."	1
"My	1
dear	1
aunt,	1
this	1
is	1
being	1
serious	1
indeed."	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
engage	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
serious	1
likewise."	1
"Well,	1
then,	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
under	1
any	1
alarm.	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
myself,	1
and	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
too.	1
He	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
me,	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
prevent	1
it."	1
"Elizabeth,	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
serious	1
now."	1
"I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,	1
I	1
will	1
try	1
again.	1
At	1
present	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Wickham;	1
no,	1
I	1
certainly	1
am	1
not.	1
But	1
he	1
is,	1
beyond	1
all	1
comparison,	1
the	1
most	1
agreeable	1
man	1
I	1
ever	1
saw--and	1
if	1
he	1
becomes	1
really	1
attached	1
to	1
me--I	1
believe	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
better	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not.	1
I	1
see	1
the	1
imprudence	1
of	1
it.	1
Oh!	1
_that_	1
abominable	1
Mr.	1
Darcy!	1
My	1
father's	1
opinion	1
of	1
me	1
does	1
me	1
the	1
greatest	1
honour,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
miserable	1
to	1
forfeit	1
it.	1
My	1
father,	1
however,	1
is	1
partial	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Wickham.	1
In	1
short,	1
my	1
dear	1
aunt,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
sorry	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
making	1
any	1
of	1
you	1
unhappy;	1
but	1
since	1
we	1
see	1
every	1
day	1
that	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
affection,	1
young	1
people	1
are	1
seldom	1
withheld	1
by	1
immediate	1
want	1
of	1
fortune	1
from	1
entering	1
into	1
engagements	1
with	1
each	1
other,	1
how	1
can	1
I	1
promise	1
to	1
be	1
wiser	1
than	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
fellow-creatures	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
tempted,	1
or	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
even	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
wisdom	1
to	1
resist?	1
All	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
promise	1
you,	1
therefore,	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
hurry.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
believe	1
myself	1
his	1
first	1
object.	1
When	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
him,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
wishing.	1
In	1
short,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
my	1
best."	1
"Perhaps	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
if	1
you	1
discourage	1
his	1
coming	1
here	1
so	1
very	1
often.	1
At	1
least,	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
_remind_	1
your	1
mother	1
of	1
inviting	1
him."	1
"As	1
I	1
did	1
the	1
other	1
day,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
with	1
a	1
conscious	1
smile:	1
"very	1
true,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
wise	1
in	1
me	1
to	1
refrain	1
from	1
_that_.	1
But	1
do	1
not	1
imagine	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
here	1
so	1
often.	1
It	1
is	1
on	1
your	1
account	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
frequently	1
invited	1
this	1
week.	1
You	1
know	1
my	1
mother's	1
ideas	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
constant	1
company	1
for	1
her	1
friends.	1
But	1
really,	1
and	1
upon	1
my	1
honour,	1
I	1
will	1
try	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
wisest;	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
are	1
satisfied."	1
Her	1
aunt	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
having	1
thanked	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
kindness	1
of	1
her	1
hints,	1
they	1
parted;	1
a	1
wonderful	1
instance	1
of	1
advice	1
being	1
given	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
point,	1
without	1
being	1
resented.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
returned	1
into	1
Hertfordshire	1
soon	1
after	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
quitted	1
by	1
the	1
Gardiners	1
and	1
Jane;	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
abode	1
with	1
the	1
Lucases,	1
his	1
arrival	1
was	1
no	1
great	1
inconvenience	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet.	1
His	1
marriage	1
was	1
now	1
fast	1
approaching,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
length	1
so	1
far	1
resigned	1
as	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
inevitable,	1
and	1
even	1
repeatedly	1
to	1
say,	1
in	1
an	1
ill-natured	1
tone,	1
that	1
she	1
"_wished_	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
happy."	1
Thursday	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
wedding	1
day,	1
and	1
on	1
Wednesday	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
paid	1
her	1
farewell	1
visit;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
rose	1
to	1
take	1
leave,	1
Elizabeth,	1
ashamed	1
of	1
her	1
mother's	1
ungracious	1
and	1
reluctant	1
good	1
wishes,	1
and	1
sincerely	1
affected	1
herself,	1
accompanied	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
As	1
they	1
went	1
downstairs	1
together,	1
Charlotte	1
said:	1
"I	1
shall	1
depend	1
on	1
hearing	1
from	1
you	1
very	1
often,	1
Eliza."	1
"_That_	1
you	1
certainly	1
shall."	1
"And	1
I	1
have	1
another	1
favour	1
to	1
ask	1
you.	1
Will	1
you	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
me?"	1
"We	1
shall	1
often	1
meet,	1
I	1
hope,	1
in	1
Hertfordshire."	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
leave	1
Kent	1
for	1
some	1
time.	1
Promise	1
me,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Hunsford."	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
refuse,	1
though	1
she	1
foresaw	1
little	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
visit.	1
"My	1
father	1
and	1
Maria	1
are	1
coming	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
March,"	1
added	1
Charlotte,	1
"and	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
consent	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
party.	1
Indeed,	1
Eliza,	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
welcome	1
as	1
either	1
of	1
them."	1
The	1
wedding	1
took	1
place;	1
the	1
bride	1
and	1
bridegroom	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
Kent	1
from	1
the	1
church	1
door,	1
and	1
everybody	1
had	1
as	1
much	1
to	1
say,	1
or	1
to	1
hear,	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
as	1
usual.	1
Elizabeth	1
soon	1
heard	1
from	1
her	1
friend;	1
and	1
their	1
correspondence	1
was	1
as	1
regular	1
and	1
frequent	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
ever	1
been;	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
equally	1
unreserved	1
was	1
impossible.	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
never	1
address	1
her	1
without	1
feeling	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
intimacy	1
was	1
over,	1
and	1
though	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
slacken	1
as	1
a	1
correspondent,	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
been,	1
rather	1
than	1
what	1
was.	1
Charlotte's	1
first	1
letters	1
were	1
received	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
eagerness;	1
there	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
be	1
curiosity	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
speak	1
of	1
her	1
new	1
home,	1
how	1
she	1
would	1
like	1
Lady	1
Catherine,	1
and	1
how	1
happy	1
she	1
would	1
dare	1
pronounce	1
herself	1
to	1
be;	1
though,	1
when	1
the	1
letters	1
were	1
read,	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
that	1
Charlotte	1
expressed	1
herself	1
on	1
every	1
point	1
exactly	1
as	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
foreseen.	1
She	1
wrote	1
cheerfully,	1
seemed	1
surrounded	1
with	1
comforts,	1
and	1
mentioned	1
nothing	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
praise.	1
The	1
house,	1
furniture,	1
neighbourhood,	1
and	1
roads,	1
were	1
all	1
to	1
her	1
taste,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Catherine's	1
behaviour	1
was	1
most	1
friendly	1
and	1
obliging.	1
It	1
was	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
picture	1
of	1
Hunsford	1
and	1
Rosings	1
rationally	1
softened;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
perceived	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
wait	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
visit	1
there	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
rest.	1
Jane	1
had	1
already	1
written	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
to	1
announce	1
their	1
safe	1
arrival	1
in	1
London;	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
wrote	1
again,	1
Elizabeth	1
hoped	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
Bingleys.	1
Her	1
impatience	1
for	1
this	1
second	1
letter	1
was	1
as	1
well	1
rewarded	1
as	1
impatience	1
generally	1
is.	1
Jane	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
week	1
in	1
town	1
without	1
either	1
seeing	1
or	1
hearing	1
from	1
Caroline.	1
She	1
accounted	1
for	1
it,	1
however,	1
by	1
supposing	1
that	1
her	1
last	1
letter	1
to	1
her	1
friend	1
from	1
Longbourn	1
had	1
by	1
some	1
accident	1
been	1
lost.	1
"My	1
aunt,"	1
she	1
continued,	1
"is	1
going	1
to-morrow	1
into	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
calling	1
in	1
Grosvenor	1
Street."	1
She	1
wrote	1
again	1
when	1
the	1
visit	1
was	1
paid,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
Miss	1
Bingley.	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
Caroline	1
in	1
spirits,"	1
were	1
her	1
words,	1
"but	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
me,	1
and	1
reproached	1
me	1
for	1
giving	1
her	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
my	1
coming	1
to	1
London.	1
I	1
was	1
right,	1
therefore,	1
my	1
last	1
letter	1
had	1
never	1
reached	1
her.	1
I	1
inquired	1
after	1
their	1
brother,	1
of	1
course.	1
He	1
was	1
well,	1
but	1
so	1
much	1
engaged	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
that	1
they	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
saw	1
him.	1
I	1
found	1
that	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
was	1
expected	1
to	1
dinner.	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
her.	1
My	1
visit	1
was	1
not	1
long,	1
as	1
Caroline	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst	1
were	1
going	1
out.	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
them	1
soon	1
here."	1
Elizabeth	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
over	1
this	1
letter.	1
It	1
convinced	1
her	1
that	1
accident	1
only	1
could	1
discover	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
her	1
sister's	1
being	1
in	1
town.	1
Four	1
weeks	1
passed	1
away,	1
and	1
Jane	1
saw	1
nothing	1
of	1
him.	1
She	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
persuade	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
regret	1
it;	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
blind	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bingley's	1
inattention.	1
After	1
waiting	1
at	1
home	1
every	1
morning	1
for	1
a	1
fortnight,	1
and	1
inventing	1
every	1
evening	1
a	1
fresh	1
excuse	1
for	1
her,	1
the	1
visitor	1
did	1
at	1
last	1
appear;	1
but	1
the	1
shortness	1
of	1
her	1
stay,	1
and	1
yet	1
more,	1
the	1
alteration	1
of	1
her	1
manner	1
would	1
allow	1
Jane	1
to	1
deceive	1
herself	1
no	1
longer.	1
The	1
letter	1
which	1
she	1
wrote	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
will	1
prove	1
what	1
she	1
felt.	1
"My	1
dearest	1
Lizzy	1
will,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
be	1
incapable	1
of	1
triumphing	1
in	1
her	1
better	1
judgement,	1
at	1
my	1
expense,	1
when	1
I	1
confess	1
myself	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
entirely	1
deceived	1
in	1
Miss	1
Bingley's	1
regard	1
for	1
me.	1
But,	1
my	1
dear	1
sister,	1
though	1
the	1
event	1
has	1
proved	1
you	1
right,	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
me	1
obstinate	1
if	1
I	1
still	1
assert	1
that,	1
considering	1
what	1
her	1
behaviour	1
was,	1
my	1
confidence	1
was	1
as	1
natural	1
as	1
your	1
suspicion.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
comprehend	1
her	1
reason	1
for	1
wishing	1
to	1
be	1
intimate	1
with	1
me;	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
same	1
circumstances	1
were	1
to	1
happen	1
again,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
deceived	1
again.	1
Caroline	1
did	1
not	1
return	1
my	1
visit	1
till	1
yesterday;	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
note,	1
not	1
a	1
line,	1
did	1
I	1
receive	1
in	1
the	1
meantime.	1
When	1
she	1
did	1
come,	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
evident	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
it;	1
she	1
made	1
a	1
slight,	1
formal	1
apology,	1
for	1
not	1
calling	1
before,	1
said	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
wishing	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
again,	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
so	1
altered	1
a	1
creature,	1
that	1
when	1
she	1
went	1
away	1
I	1
was	1
perfectly	1
resolved	1
to	1
continue	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
no	1
longer.	1
I	1
pity,	1
though	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
blaming	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
very	1
wrong	1
in	1
singling	1
me	1
out	1
as	1
she	1
did;	1
I	1
can	1
safely	1
say	1
that	1
every	1
advance	1
to	1
intimacy	1
began	1
on	1
her	1
side.	1
But	1
I	1
pity	1
her,	1
because	1
she	1
must	1
feel	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
acting	1
wrong,	1
and	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sure	1
that	1
anxiety	1
for	1
her	1
brother	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
explain	1
myself	1
farther;	1
and	1
though	1
_we_	1
know	1
this	1
anxiety	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
needless,	1
yet	1
if	1
she	1
feels	1
it,	1
it	1
will	1
easily	1
account	1
for	1
her	1
behaviour	1
to	1
me;	1
and	1
so	1
deservedly	1
dear	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
his	1
sister,	1
whatever	1
anxiety	1
she	1
must	1
feel	1
on	1
his	1
behalf	1
is	1
natural	1
and	1
amiable.	1
I	1
cannot	1
but	1
wonder,	1
however,	1
at	1
her	1
having	1
any	1
such	1
fears	1
now,	1
because,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
all	1
cared	1
about	1
me,	1
we	1
must	1
have	1
met,	1
long	1
ago.	1
He	1
knows	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
in	1
town,	1
I	1
am	1
certain,	1
from	1
something	1
she	1
said	1
herself;	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
would	1
seem,	1
by	1
her	1
manner	1
of	1
talking,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
persuade	1
herself	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
really	1
partial	1
to	1
Miss	1
Darcy.	1
I	1
cannot	1
understand	1
it.	1
If	1
I	1
were	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
judging	1
harshly,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
almost	1
tempted	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
strong	1
appearance	1
of	1
duplicity	1
in	1
all	1
this.	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
endeavour	1
to	1
banish	1
every	1
painful	1
thought,	1
and	1
think	1
only	1
of	1
what	1
will	1
make	1
me	1
happy--your	1
affection,	1
and	1
the	1
invariable	1
kindness	1
of	1
my	1
dear	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt.	1
Let	1
me	1
hear	1
from	1
you	1
very	1
soon.	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
said	1
something	1
of	1
his	1
never	1
returning	1
to	1
Netherfield	1
again,	1
of	1
giving	1
up	1
the	1
house,	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
any	1
certainty.	1
We	1
had	1
better	1
not	1
mention	1
it.	1
I	1
am	1
extremely	1
glad	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
such	1
pleasant	1
accounts	1
from	1
our	1
friends	1
at	1
Hunsford.	1
Pray	1
go	1
to	1
see	1
them,	1
with	1
Sir	1
William	1
and	1
Maria.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
comfortable	1
there.--Yours,	1
etc."	1
This	1
letter	1
gave	1
Elizabeth	1
some	1
pain;	1
but	1
her	1
spirits	1
returned	1
as	1
she	1
considered	1
that	1
Jane	1
would	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
duped,	1
by	1
the	1
sister	1
at	1
least.	1
All	1
expectation	1
from	1
the	1
brother	1
was	1
now	1
absolutely	1
over.	1
She	1
would	1
not	1
even	1
wish	1
for	1
a	1
renewal	1
of	1
his	1
attentions.	1
His	1
character	1
sunk	1
on	1
every	1
review	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
punishment	1
for	1
him,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
possible	1
advantage	1
to	1
Jane,	1
she	1
seriously	1
hoped	1
he	1
might	1
really	1
soon	1
marry	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
sister,	1
as	1
by	1
Wickham's	1
account,	1
she	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
abundantly	1
regret	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
thrown	1
away.	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
about	1
this	1
time	1
reminded	1
Elizabeth	1
of	1
her	1
promise	1
concerning	1
that	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
required	1
information;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
such	1
to	1
send	1
as	1
might	1
rather	1
give	1
contentment	1
to	1
her	1
aunt	1
than	1
to	1
herself.	1
His	1
apparent	1
partiality	1
had	1
subsided,	1
his	1
attentions	1
were	1
over,	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
admirer	1
of	1
some	1
one	1
else.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
watchful	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
all,	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
it	1
and	1
write	1
of	1
it	1
without	1
material	1
pain.	1
Her	1
heart	1
had	1
been	1
but	1
slightly	1
touched,	1
and	1
her	1
vanity	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
believing	1
that	1
_she_	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
his	1
only	1
choice,	1
had	1
fortune	1
permitted	1
it.	1
The	1
sudden	1
acquisition	1
of	1
ten	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
remarkable	1
charm	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
rendering	1
himself	1
agreeable;	1
but	1
Elizabeth,	1
less	1
clear-sighted	1
perhaps	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
than	1
in	1
Charlotte's,	1
did	1
not	1
quarrel	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
wish	1
of	1
independence.	1
Nothing,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
natural;	1
and	1
while	1
able	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
it	1
cost	1
him	1
a	1
few	1
struggles	1
to	1
relinquish	1
her,	1
she	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
allow	1
it	1
a	1
wise	1
and	1
desirable	1
measure	1
for	1
both,	1
and	1
could	1
very	1
sincerely	1
wish	1
him	1
happy.	1
All	1
this	1
was	1
acknowledged	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner;	1
and	1
after	1
relating	1
the	1
circumstances,	1
she	1
thus	1
went	1
on:	1
"I	1
am	1
now	1
convinced,	1
my	1
dear	1
aunt,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
much	1
in	1
love;	1
for	1
had	1
I	1
really	1
experienced	1
that	1
pure	1
and	1
elevating	1
passion,	1
I	1
should	1
at	1
present	1
detest	1
his	1
very	1
name,	1
and	1
wish	1
him	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
evil.	1
But	1
my	1
feelings	1
are	1
not	1
only	1
cordial	1
towards	1
_him_;	1
they	1
are	1
even	1
impartial	1
towards	1
Miss	1
King.	1
I	1
cannot	1
find	1
out	1
that	1
I	1
hate	1
her	1
at	1
all,	1
or	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
unwilling	1
to	1
think	1
her	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
sort	1
of	1
girl.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
love	1
in	1
all	1
this.	1
My	1
watchfulness	1
has	1
been	1
effectual;	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
certainly	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
more	1
interesting	1
object	1
to	1
all	1
my	1
acquaintances	1
were	1
I	1
distractedly	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him,	1
I	1
cannot	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
regret	1
my	1
comparative	1
insignificance.	1
Importance	1
may	1
sometimes	1
be	1
purchased	1
too	1
dearly.	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Lydia	1
take	1
his	1
defection	1
much	1
more	1
to	1
heart	1
than	1
I	1
do.	1
They	1
are	1
young	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
not	1
yet	1
open	1
to	1
the	1
mortifying	1
conviction	1
that	1
handsome	1
young	1
men	1
must	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
live	1
on	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
plain."	1
Chapter	1
27	1
With	1
no	1
greater	1
events	1
than	1
these	1
in	1
the	1
Longbourn	1
family,	1
and	1
otherwise	1
diversified	1
by	1
little	1
beyond	1
the	1
walks	1
to	1
Meryton,	1
sometimes	1
dirty	1
and	1
sometimes	1
cold,	1
did	1
January	1
and	1
February	1
pass	1
away.	1
March	1
was	1
to	1
take	1
Elizabeth	1
to	1
Hunsford.	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
thought	1
very	1
seriously	1
of	1
going	1
thither;	1
but	1
Charlotte,	1
she	1
soon	1
found,	1
was	1
depending	1
on	1
the	1
plan	1
and	1
she	1
gradually	1
learned	1
to	1
consider	1
it	1
herself	1
with	1
greater	1
pleasure	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
greater	1
certainty.	1
Absence	1
had	1
increased	1
her	1
desire	1
of	1
seeing	1
Charlotte	1
again,	1
and	1
weakened	1
her	1
disgust	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Collins.	1
There	1
was	1
novelty	1
in	1
the	1
scheme,	1
and	1
as,	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
mother	1
and	1
such	1
uncompanionable	1
sisters,	1
home	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
faultless,	1
a	1
little	1
change	1
was	1
not	1
unwelcome	1
for	1
its	1
own	1
sake.	1
The	1
journey	1
would	1
moreover	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
peep	1
at	1
Jane;	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
as	1
the	1
time	1
drew	1
near,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
sorry	1
for	1
any	1
delay.	1
Everything,	1
however,	1
went	1
on	1
smoothly,	1
and	1
was	1
finally	1
settled	1
according	1
to	1
Charlotte's	1
first	1
sketch.	1
She	1
was	1
to	1
accompany	1
Sir	1
William	1
and	1
his	1
second	1
daughter.	1
The	1
improvement	1
of	1
spending	1
a	1
night	1
in	1
London	1
was	1
added	1
in	1
time,	1
and	1
the	1
plan	1
became	1
perfect	1
as	1
plan	1
could	1
be.	1
The	1
only	1
pain	1
was	1
in	1
leaving	1
her	1
father,	1
who	1
would	1
certainly	1
miss	1
her,	1
and	1
who,	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
point,	1
so	1
little	1
liked	1
her	1
going,	1
that	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
almost	1
promised	1
to	1
answer	1
her	1
letter.	1
The	1
farewell	1
between	1
herself	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
was	1
perfectly	1
friendly;	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
even	1
more.	1
His	1
present	1
pursuit	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
him	1
forget	1
that	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
excite	1
and	1
to	1
deserve	1
his	1
attention,	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
listen	1
and	1
to	1
pity,	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
be	1
admired;	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
manner	1
of	1
bidding	1
her	1
adieu,	1
wishing	1
her	1
every	1
enjoyment,	1
reminding	1
her	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
expect	1
in	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh,	1
and	1
trusting	1
their	1
opinion	1
of	1
her--their	1
opinion	1
of	1
everybody--would	1
always	1
coincide,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
solicitude,	1
an	1
interest	1
which	1
she	1
felt	1
must	1
ever	1
attach	1
her	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
most	1
sincere	1
regard;	1
and	1
she	1
parted	1
from	1
him	1
convinced	1
that,	1
whether	1
married	1
or	1
single,	1
he	1
must	1
always	1
be	1
her	1
model	1
of	1
the	1
amiable	1
and	1
pleasing.	1
Her	1
fellow-travellers	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
were	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
kind	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
think	1
him	1
less	1
agreeable.	1
Sir	1
William	1
Lucas,	1
and	1
his	1
daughter	1
Maria,	1
a	1
good-humoured	1
girl,	1
but	1
as	1
empty-headed	1
as	1
himself,	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
worth	1
hearing,	1
and	1
were	1
listened	1
to	1
with	1
about	1
as	1
much	1
delight	1
as	1
the	1
rattle	1
of	1
the	1
chaise.	1
Elizabeth	1
loved	1
absurdities,	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
Sir	1
William's	1
too	1
long.	1
He	1
could	1
tell	1
her	1
nothing	1
new	1
of	1
the	1
wonders	1
of	1
his	1
presentation	1
and	1
knighthood;	1
and	1
his	1
civilities	1
were	1
worn	1
out,	1
like	1
his	1
information.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
journey	1
of	1
only	1
twenty-four	1
miles,	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
it	1
so	1
early	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
Gracechurch	1
Street	1
by	1
noon.	1
As	1
they	1
drove	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner's	1
door,	1
Jane	1
was	1
at	1
a	1
drawing-room	1
window	1
watching	1
their	1
arrival;	1
when	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
passage	1
she	1
was	1
there	1
to	1
welcome	1
them,	1
and	1
Elizabeth,	1
looking	1
earnestly	1
in	1
her	1
face,	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
healthful	1
and	1
lovely	1
as	1
ever.	1
On	1
the	1
stairs	1
were	1
a	1
troop	1
of	1
little	1
boys	1
and	1
girls,	1
whose	1
eagerness	1
for	1
their	1
cousin's	1
appearance	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
them	1
to	1
wait	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
and	1
whose	1
shyness,	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
twelvemonth,	1
prevented	1
their	1
coming	1
lower.	1
All	1
was	1
joy	1
and	1
kindness.	1
The	1
day	1
passed	1
most	1
pleasantly	1
away;	1
the	1
morning	1
in	1
bustle	1
and	1
shopping,	1
and	1
the	1
evening	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
theatres.	1
Elizabeth	1
then	1
contrived	1
to	1
sit	1
by	1
her	1
aunt.	1
Their	1
first	1
object	1
was	1
her	1
sister;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
more	1
grieved	1
than	1
astonished	1
to	1
hear,	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
her	1
minute	1
inquiries,	1
that	1
though	1
Jane	1
always	1
struggled	1
to	1
support	1
her	1
spirits,	1
there	1
were	1
periods	1
of	1
dejection.	1
It	1
was	1
reasonable,	1
however,	1
to	1
hope	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
continue	1
long.	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
particulars	1
also	1
of	1
Miss	1
Bingley's	1
visit	1
in	1
Gracechurch	1
Street,	1
and	1
repeated	1
conversations	1
occurring	1
at	1
different	1
times	1
between	1
Jane	1
and	1
herself,	1
which	1
proved	1
that	1
the	1
former	1
had,	1
from	1
her	1
heart,	1
given	1
up	1
the	1
acquaintance.	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
then	1
rallied	1
her	1
niece	1
on	1
Wickham's	1
desertion,	1
and	1
complimented	1
her	1
on	1
bearing	1
it	1
so	1
well.	1
"But	1
my	1
dear	1
Elizabeth,"	1
she	1
added,	1
"what	1
sort	1
of	1
girl	1
is	1
Miss	1
King?	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
sorry	1
to	1
think	1
our	1
friend	1
mercenary."	1
"Pray,	1
my	1
dear	1
aunt,	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
difference	1
in	1
matrimonial	1
affairs,	1
between	1
the	1
mercenary	1
and	1
the	1
prudent	1
motive?	1
Where	1
does	1
discretion	1
end,	1
and	1
avarice	1
begin?	1
Last	1
Christmas	1
you	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
his	1
marrying	1
me,	1
because	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
imprudent;	1
and	1
now,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
trying	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
girl	1
with	1
only	1
ten	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
mercenary."	1
"If	1
you	1
will	1
only	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
girl	1
Miss	1
King	1
is,	1
I	1
shall	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
think."	1
"She	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
kind	1
of	1
girl,	1
I	1
believe.	1
I	1
know	1
no	1
harm	1
of	1
her."	1
"But	1
he	1
paid	1
her	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
attention	1
till	1
her	1
grandfather's	1
death	1
made	1
her	1
mistress	1
of	1
this	1
fortune."	1
"No--why	1
should	1
he?	1
If	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
allowable	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
gain	1
_my_	1
affections	1
because	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
money,	1
what	1
occasion	1
could	1
there	1
be	1
for	1
making	1
love	1
to	1
a	1
girl	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
about,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
equally	1
poor?"	1
"But	1
there	1
seems	1
an	1
indelicacy	1
in	1
directing	1
his	1
attentions	1
towards	1
her	1
so	1
soon	1
after	1
this	1
event."	1
"A	1
man	1
in	1
distressed	1
circumstances	1
has	1
not	1
time	1
for	1
all	1
those	1
elegant	1
decorums	1
which	1
other	1
people	1
may	1
observe.	1
If	1
_she_	1
does	1
not	1
object	1
to	1
it,	1
why	1
should	1
_we_?"	1
"_Her_	1
not	1
objecting	1
does	1
not	1
justify	1
_him_.	1
It	1
only	1
shows	1
her	1
being	1
deficient	1
in	1
something	1
herself--sense	1
or	1
feeling."	1
"Well,"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth,	1
"have	1
it	1
as	1
you	1
choose.	1
_He_	1
shall	1
be	1
mercenary,	1
and	1
_she_	1
shall	1
be	1
foolish."	1
"No,	1
Lizzy,	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
do	1
_not_	1
choose.	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
sorry,	1
you	1
know,	1
to	1
think	1
ill	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
lived	1
so	1
long	1
in	1
Derbyshire."	1
"Oh!	1
if	1
that	1
is	1
all,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
poor	1
opinion	1
of	1
young	1
men	1
who	1
live	1
in	1
Derbyshire;	1
and	1
their	1
intimate	1
friends	1
who	1
live	1
in	1
Hertfordshire	1
are	1
not	1
much	1
better.	1
I	1
am	1
sick	1
of	1
them	1
all.	1
Thank	1
Heaven!	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to-morrow	1
where	1
I	1
shall	1
find	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
not	1
one	1
agreeable	1
quality,	1
who	1
has	1
neither	1
manner	1
nor	1
sense	1
to	1
recommend	1
him.	1
Stupid	1
men	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
ones	1
worth	1
knowing,	1
after	1
all."	1
"Take	1
care,	1
Lizzy;	1
that	1
speech	1
savours	1
strongly	1
of	1
disappointment."	1
Before	1
they	1
were	1
separated	1
by	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
the	1
play,	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
unexpected	1
happiness	1
of	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
accompany	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
in	1
a	1
tour	1
of	1
pleasure	1
which	1
they	1
proposed	1
taking	1
in	1
the	1
summer.	1
"We	1
have	1
not	1
determined	1
how	1
far	1
it	1
shall	1
carry	1
us,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
"but,	1
perhaps,	1
to	1
the	1
Lakes."	1
No	1
scheme	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
agreeable	1
to	1
Elizabeth,	1
and	1
her	1
acceptance	1
of	1
the	1
invitation	1
was	1
most	1
ready	1
and	1
grateful.	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
dear,	1
dear	1
aunt,"	1
she	1
rapturously	1
cried,	1
"what	1
delight!	1
what	1
felicity!	1
You	1
give	1
me	1
fresh	1
life	1
and	1
vigour.	1
Adieu	1
to	1
disappointment	1
and	1
spleen.	1
What	1
are	1
young	1
men	1
to	1
rocks	1
and	1
mountains?	1
Oh!	1
what	1
hours	1
of	1
transport	1
we	1
shall	1
spend!	1
And	1
when	1
we	1
_do_	1
return,	1
it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
like	1
other	1
travellers,	1
without	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
one	1
accurate	1
idea	1
of	1
anything.	1
We	1
_will_	1
know	1
where	1
we	1
have	1
gone--we	1
_will_	1
recollect	1
what	1
we	1
have	1
seen.	1
Lakes,	1
mountains,	1
and	1
rivers	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
jumbled	1
together	1
in	1
our	1
imaginations;	1
nor	1
when	1
we	1
attempt	1
to	1
describe	1
any	1
particular	1
scene,	1
will	1
we	1
begin	1
quarreling	1
about	1
its	1
relative	1
situation.	1
Let	1
_our_	1
first	1
effusions	1
be	1
less	1
insupportable	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
generality	1
of	1
travellers."	1
Chapter	1
28	1
Every	1
object	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
day's	1
journey	1
was	1
new	1
and	1
interesting	1
to	1
Elizabeth;	1
and	1
her	1
spirits	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
enjoyment;	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
sister	1
looking	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
banish	1
all	1
fear	1
for	1
her	1
health,	1
and	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
her	1
northern	1
tour	1
was	1
a	1
constant	1
source	1
of	1
delight.	1
When	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
high	1
road	1
for	1
the	1
lane	1
to	1
Hunsford,	1
every	1
eye	1
was	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
Parsonage,	1
and	1
every	1
turning	1
expected	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
in	1
view.	1
The	1
palings	1
of	1
Rosings	1
Park	1
was	1
their	1
boundary	1
on	1
one	1
side.	1
Elizabeth	1
smiled	1
at	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
its	1
inhabitants.	1
At	1
length	1
the	1
Parsonage	1
was	1
discernible.	1
The	1
garden	1
sloping	1
to	1
the	1
road,	1
the	1
house	1
standing	1
in	1
it,	1
the	1
green	1
pales,	1
and	1
the	1
laurel	1
hedge,	1
everything	1
declared	1
they	1
were	1
arriving.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
and	1
Charlotte	1
appeared	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
the	1
carriage	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
small	1
gate	1
which	1
led	1
by	1
a	1
short	1
gravel	1
walk	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
amidst	1
the	1
nods	1
and	1
smiles	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
party.	1
In	1
a	1
moment	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
chaise,	1
rejoicing	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
each	1
other.	1
Mrs.	1
Collins	1
welcomed	1
her	1
friend	1
with	1
the	1
liveliest	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
satisfied	1
with	1
coming	1
when	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
so	1
affectionately	1
received.	1
She	1
saw	1
instantly	1
that	1
her	1
cousin's	1
manners	1
were	1
not	1
altered	1
by	1
his	1
marriage;	1
his	1
formal	1
civility	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
it	1
had	1
been,	1
and	1
he	1
detained	1
her	1
some	1
minutes	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
to	1
hear	1
and	1
satisfy	1
his	1
inquiries	1
after	1
all	1
her	1
family.	1
They	1
were	1
then,	1
with	1
no	1
other	1
delay	1
than	1
his	1
pointing	1
out	1
the	1
neatness	1
of	1
the	1
entrance,	1
taken	1
into	1
the	1
house;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
parlour,	1
he	1
welcomed	1
them	1
a	1
second	1
time,	1
with	1
ostentatious	1
formality	1
to	1
his	1
humble	1
abode,	1
and	1
punctually	1
repeated	1
all	1
his	1
wife's	1
offers	1
of	1
refreshment.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
prepared	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
glory;	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
in	1
fancying	1
that	1
in	1
displaying	1
the	1
good	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
its	1
aspect	1
and	1
its	1
furniture,	1
he	1
addressed	1
himself	1
particularly	1
to	1
her,	1
as	1
if	1
wishing	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
feel	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
lost	1
in	1
refusing	1
him.	1
But	1
though	1
everything	1
seemed	1
neat	1
and	1
comfortable,	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
gratify	1
him	1
by	1
any	1
sigh	1
of	1
repentance,	1
and	1
rather	1
looked	1
with	1
wonder	1
at	1
her	1
friend	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
so	1
cheerful	1
an	1
air	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
companion.	1
When	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
said	1
anything	1
of	1
which	1
his	1
wife	1
might	1
reasonably	1
be	1
ashamed,	1
which	1
certainly	1
was	1
not	1
unseldom,	1
she	1
involuntarily	1
turned	1
her	1
eye	1
on	1
Charlotte.	1
Once	1
or	1
twice	1
she	1
could	1
discern	1
a	1
faint	1
blush;	1
but	1
in	1
general	1
Charlotte	1
wisely	1
did	1
not	1
hear.	1
After	1
sitting	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
admire	1
every	1
article	1
of	1
furniture	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
from	1
the	1
sideboard	1
to	1
the	1
fender,	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
their	1
journey,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
in	1
London,	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
invited	1
them	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
stroll	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
which	1
was	1
large	1
and	1
well	1
laid	1
out,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
cultivation	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
attended	1
himself.	1
To	1
work	1
in	1
this	1
garden	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
most	1
respectable	1
pleasures;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
admired	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
countenance	1
with	1
which	1
Charlotte	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
healthfulness	1
of	1
the	1
exercise,	1
and	1
owned	1
she	1
encouraged	1
it	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible.	1
Here,	1
leading	1
the	1
way	1
through	1
every	1
walk	1
and	1
cross	1
walk,	1
and	1
scarcely	1
allowing	1
them	1
an	1
interval	1
to	1
utter	1
the	1
praises	1
he	1
asked	1
for,	1
every	1
view	1
was	1
pointed	1
out	1
with	1
a	1
minuteness	1
which	1
left	1
beauty	1
entirely	1
behind.	1
He	1
could	1
number	1
the	1
fields	1
in	1
every	1
direction,	1
and	1
could	1
tell	1
how	1
many	1
trees	1
there	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
distant	1
clump.	1
But	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
views	1
which	1
his	1
garden,	1
or	1
which	1
the	1
country	1
or	1
kingdom	1
could	1
boast,	1
none	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
Rosings,	1
afforded	1
by	1
an	1
opening	1
in	1
the	1
trees	1
that	1
bordered	1
the	1
park	1
nearly	1
opposite	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
his	1
house.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
handsome	1
modern	1
building,	1
well	1
situated	1
on	1
rising	1
ground.	1
From	1
his	1
garden,	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
would	1
have	1
led	1
them	1
round	1
his	1
two	1
meadows;	1
but	1
the	1
ladies,	1
not	1
having	1
shoes	1
to	1
encounter	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
a	1
white	1
frost,	1
turned	1
back;	1
and	1
while	1
Sir	1
William	1
accompanied	1
him,	1
Charlotte	1
took	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
friend	1
over	1
the	1
house,	1
extremely	1
well	1
pleased,	1
probably,	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
showing	1
it	1
without	1
her	1
husband's	1
help.	1
It	1
was	1
rather	1
small,	1
but	1
well	1
built	1
and	1
convenient;	1
and	1
everything	1
was	1
fitted	1
up	1
and	1
arranged	1
with	1
a	1
neatness	1
and	1
consistency	1
of	1
which	1
Elizabeth	1
gave	1
Charlotte	1
all	1
the	1
credit.	1
When	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
could	1
be	1
forgotten,	1
there	1
was	1
really	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
great	1
comfort	1
throughout,	1
and	1
by	1
Charlotte's	1
evident	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
it,	1
Elizabeth	1
supposed	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
often	1
forgotten.	1
She	1
had	1
already	1
learnt	1
that	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
It	1
was	1
spoken	1
of	1
again	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
dinner,	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
joining	1
in,	1
observed:	1
"Yes,	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth,	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
seeing	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
on	1
the	1
ensuing	1
Sunday	1
at	1
church,	1
and	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
say	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
delighted	1
with	1
her.	1
She	1
is	1
all	1
affability	1
and	1
condescension,	1
and	1
I	1
doubt	1
not	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
honoured	1
with	1
some	1
portion	1
of	1
her	1
notice	1
when	1
service	1
is	1
over.	1
I	1
have	1
scarcely	1
any	1
hesitation	1
in	1
saying	1
she	1
will	1
include	1
you	1
and	1
my	1
sister	1
Maria	1
in	1
every	1
invitation	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
honours	1
us	1
during	1
your	1
stay	1
here.	1
Her	1
behaviour	1
to	1
my	1
dear	1
Charlotte	1
is	1
charming.	1
We	1
dine	1
at	1
Rosings	1
twice	1
every	1
week,	1
and	1
are	1
never	1
allowed	1
to	1
walk	1
home.	1
Her	1
ladyship's	1
carriage	1
is	1
regularly	1
ordered	1
for	1
us.	1
I	1
_should_	1
say,	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
ladyship's	1
carriages,	1
for	1
she	1
has	1
several."	1
"Lady	1
Catherine	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
respectable,	1
sensible	1
woman	1
indeed,"	1
added	1
Charlotte,	1
"and	1
a	1
most	1
attentive	1
neighbour."	1
"Very	1
true,	1
my	1
dear,	1
that	1
is	1
exactly	1
what	1
I	1
say.	1
She	1
is	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
woman	1
whom	1
one	1
cannot	1
regard	1
with	1
too	1
much	1
deference."	1
The	1
evening	1
was	1
spent	1
chiefly	1
in	1
talking	1
over	1
Hertfordshire	1
news,	1
and	1
telling	1
again	1
what	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
written;	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
closed,	1
Elizabeth,	1
in	1
the	1
solitude	1
of	1
her	1
chamber,	1
had	1
to	1
meditate	1
upon	1
Charlotte's	1
degree	1
of	1
contentment,	1
to	1
understand	1
her	1
address	1
in	1
guiding,	1
and	1
composure	1
in	1
bearing	1
with,	1
her	1
husband,	1
and	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
done	1
very	1
well.	1
She	1
had	1
also	1
to	1
anticipate	1
how	1
her	1
visit	1
would	1
pass,	1
the	1
quiet	1
tenor	1
of	1
their	1
usual	1
employments,	1
the	1
vexatious	1
interruptions	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
and	1
the	1
gaieties	1
of	1
their	1
intercourse	1
with	1
Rosings.	1
A	1
lively	1
imagination	1
soon	1
settled	1
it	1
all.	1
About	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
getting	1
ready	1
for	1
a	1
walk,	1
a	1
sudden	1
noise	1
below	1
seemed	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
in	1
confusion;	1
and,	1
after	1
listening	1
a	1
moment,	1
she	1
heard	1
somebody	1
running	1
up	1
stairs	1
in	1
a	1
violent	1
hurry,	1
and	1
calling	1
loudly	1
after	1
her.	1
She	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
met	1
Maria	1
in	1
the	1
landing	1
place,	1
who,	1
breathless	1
with	1
agitation,	1
cried	1
out--	1
"Oh,	1
my	1
dear	1
Eliza!	1
pray	1
make	1
haste	1
and	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
dining-room,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
sight	1
to	1
be	1
seen!	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
it	1
is.	1
Make	1
haste,	1
and	1
come	1
down	1
this	1
moment."	1
Elizabeth	1
asked	1
questions	1
in	1
vain;	1
Maria	1
would	1
tell	1
her	1
nothing	1
more,	1
and	1
down	1
they	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
dining-room,	1
which	1
fronted	1
the	1
lane,	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
this	1
wonder;	1
It	1
was	1
two	1
ladies	1
stopping	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
phaeton	1
at	1
the	1
garden	1
gate.	1
"And	1
is	1
this	1
all?"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth.	1
"I	1
expected	1
at	1
least	1
that	1
the	1
pigs	1
were	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
garden,	1
and	1
here	1
is	1
nothing	1
but	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
and	1
her	1
daughter."	1
"La!	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Maria,	1
quite	1
shocked	1
at	1
the	1
mistake,	1
"it	1
is	1
not	1
Lady	1
Catherine.	1
The	1
old	1
lady	1
is	1
Mrs.	1
Jenkinson,	1
who	1
lives	1
with	1
them;	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh.	1
Only	1
look	1
at	1
her.	1
She	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
little	1
creature.	1
Who	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
thin	1
and	1
small?"	1
"She	1
is	1
abominably	1
rude	1
to	1
keep	1
Charlotte	1
out	1
of	1
doors	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
wind.	1
Why	1
does	1
she	1
not	1
come	1
in?"	1
"Oh,	1
Charlotte	1
says	1
she	1
hardly	1
ever	1
does.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
favours	1
when	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
comes	1
in."	1
"I	1
like	1
her	1
appearance,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
struck	1
with	1
other	1
ideas.	1
"She	1
looks	1
sickly	1
and	1
cross.	1
Yes,	1
she	1
will	1
do	1
for	1
him	1
very	1
well.	1
She	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
very	1
proper	1
wife."	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
and	1
Charlotte	1
were	1
both	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
ladies;	1
and	1
Sir	1
William,	1
to	1
Elizabeth's	1
high	1
diversion,	1
was	1
stationed	1
in	1
the	1
doorway,	1
in	1
earnest	1
contemplation	1
of	1
the	1
greatness	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
constantly	1
bowing	1
whenever	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
looked	1
that	1
way.	1
At	1
length	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
said;	1
the	1
ladies	1
drove	1
on,	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
returned	1
into	1
the	1
house.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
no	1
sooner	1
saw	1
the	1
two	1
girls	1
than	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
congratulate	1
them	1
on	1
their	1
good	1
fortune,	1
which	1
Charlotte	1
explained	1
by	1
letting	1
them	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
was	1
asked	1
to	1
dine	1
at	1
Rosings	1
the	1
next	1
day.	1
Chapter	1
29	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
triumph,	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
invitation,	1
was	1
complete.	1
The	1
power	1
of	1
displaying	1
the	1
grandeur	1
of	1
his	1
patroness	1
to	1
his	1
wondering	1
visitors,	1
and	1
of	1
letting	1
them	1
see	1
her	1
civility	1
towards	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
was	1
exactly	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
wished	1
for;	1
and	1
that	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
doing	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
given	1
so	1
soon,	1
was	1
such	1
an	1
instance	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine's	1
condescension,	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
admire	1
enough.	1
"I	1
confess,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
surprised	1
by	1
her	1
ladyship's	1
asking	1
us	1
on	1
Sunday	1
to	1
drink	1
tea	1
and	1
spend	1
the	1
evening	1
at	1
Rosings.	1
I	1
rather	1
expected,	1
from	1
my	1
knowledge	1
of	1
her	1
affability,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
happen.	1
But	1
who	1
could	1
have	1
foreseen	1
such	1
an	1
attention	1
as	1
this?	1
Who	1
could	1
have	1
imagined	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
receive	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
dine	1
there	1
(an	1
invitation,	1
moreover,	1
including	1
the	1
whole	1
party)	1
so	1
immediately	1
after	1
your	1
arrival!"	1
"I	1
am	1
the	1
less	1
surprised	1
at	1
what	1
has	1
happened,"	1
replied	1
Sir	1
William,	1
"from	1
that	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
manners	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
really	1
are,	1
which	1
my	1
situation	1
in	1
life	1
has	1
allowed	1
me	1
to	1
acquire.	1
About	1
the	1
court,	1
such	1
instances	1
of	1
elegant	1
breeding	1
are	1
not	1
uncommon."	1
Scarcely	1
anything	1
was	1
talked	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
or	1
next	1
morning	1
but	1
their	1
visit	1
to	1
Rosings.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
was	1
carefully	1
instructing	1
them	1
in	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
expect,	1
that	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
such	1
rooms,	1
so	1
many	1
servants,	1
and	1
so	1
splendid	1
a	1
dinner,	1
might	1
not	1
wholly	1
overpower	1
them.	1
When	1
the	1
ladies	1
were	1
separating	1
for	1
the	1
toilette,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Elizabeth--	1
"Do	1
not	1
make	1
yourself	1
uneasy,	1
my	1
dear	1
cousin,	1
about	1
your	1
apparel.	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
is	1
far	1
from	1
requiring	1
that	1
elegance	1
of	1
dress	1
in	1
us	1
which	1
becomes	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
daughter.	1
I	1
would	1
advise	1
you	1
merely	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
whatever	1
of	1
your	1
clothes	1
is	1
superior	1
to	1
the	1
rest--there	1
is	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
anything	1
more.	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
will	1
not	1
think	1
the	1
worse	1
of	1
you	1
for	1
being	1
simply	1
dressed.	1
She	1
likes	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
distinction	1
of	1
rank	1
preserved."	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
dressing,	1
he	1
came	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
to	1
their	1
different	1
doors,	1
to	1
recommend	1
their	1
being	1
quick,	1
as	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
very	1
much	1
objected	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
dinner.	1
Such	1
formidable	1
accounts	1
of	1
her	1
ladyship,	1
and	1
her	1
manner	1
of	1
living,	1
quite	1
frightened	1
Maria	1
Lucas	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
little	1
used	1
to	1
company,	1
and	1
she	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
her	1
introduction	1
at	1
Rosings	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
apprehension	1
as	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
his	1
presentation	1
at	1
St.	1
James's.	1
As	1
the	1
weather	1
was	1
fine,	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
pleasant	1
walk	1
of	1
about	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
across	1
the	1
park.	1
Every	1
park	1
has	1
its	1
beauty	1
and	1
its	1
prospects;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
saw	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
pleased	1
with,	1
though	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
such	1
raptures	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
expected	1
the	1
scene	1
to	1
inspire,	1
and	1
was	1
but	1
slightly	1
affected	1
by	1
his	1
enumeration	1
of	1
the	1
windows	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
his	1
relation	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
glazing	1
altogether	1
had	1
originally	1
cost	1
Sir	1
Lewis	1
de	1
Bourgh.	1
When	1
they	1
ascended	1
the	1
steps	1
to	1
the	1
hall,	1
Maria's	1
alarm	1
was	1
every	1
moment	1
increasing,	1
and	1
even	1
Sir	1
William	1
did	1
not	1
look	1
perfectly	1
calm.	1
Elizabeth's	1
courage	1
did	1
not	1
fail	1
her.	1
She	1
had	1
heard	1
nothing	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
that	1
spoke	1
her	1
awful	1
from	1
any	1
extraordinary	1
talents	1
or	1
miraculous	1
virtue,	1
and	1
the	1
mere	1
stateliness	1
of	1
money	1
or	1
rank	1
she	1
thought	1
she	1
could	1
witness	1
without	1
trepidation.	1
From	1
the	1
entrance-hall,	1
of	1
which	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
pointed	1
out,	1
with	1
a	1
rapturous	1
air,	1
the	1
fine	1
proportion	1
and	1
the	1
finished	1
ornaments,	1
they	1
followed	1
the	1
servants	1
through	1
an	1
ante-chamber,	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
Lady	1
Catherine,	1
her	1
daughter,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Jenkinson	1
were	1
sitting.	1
Her	1
ladyship,	1
with	1
great	1
condescension,	1
arose	1
to	1
receive	1
them;	1
and	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Collins	1
had	1
settled	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
that	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
introduction	1
should	1
be	1
hers,	1
it	1
was	1
performed	1
in	1
a	1
proper	1
manner,	1
without	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
apologies	1
and	1
thanks	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
necessary.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
at	1
St.	1
James's	1
Sir	1
William	1
was	1
so	1
completely	1
awed	1
by	1
the	1
grandeur	1
surrounding	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
just	1
courage	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
very	1
low	1
bow,	1
and	1
take	1
his	1
seat	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word;	1
and	1
his	1
daughter,	1
frightened	1
almost	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
senses,	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
her	1
chair,	1
not	1
knowing	1
which	1
way	1
to	1
look.	1
Elizabeth	1
found	1
herself	1
quite	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
scene,	1
and	1
could	1
observe	1
the	1
three	1
ladies	1
before	1
her	1
composedly.	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
was	1
a	1
tall,	1
large	1
woman,	1
with	1
strongly-marked	1
features,	1
which	1
might	1
once	1
have	1
been	1
handsome.	1
Her	1
air	1
was	1
not	1
conciliating,	1
nor	1
was	1
her	1
manner	1
of	1
receiving	1
them	1
such	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
visitors	1
forget	1
their	1
inferior	1
rank.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
rendered	1
formidable	1
by	1
silence;	1
but	1
whatever	1
she	1
said	1
was	1
spoken	1
in	1
so	1
authoritative	1
a	1
tone,	1
as	1
marked	1
her	1
self-importance,	1
and	1
brought	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
immediately	1
to	1
Elizabeth's	1
mind;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
observation	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
altogether,	1
she	1
believed	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
to	1
be	1
exactly	1
what	1
he	1
represented.	1
When,	1
after	1
examining	1
the	1
mother,	1
in	1
whose	1
countenance	1
and	1
deportment	1
she	1
soon	1
found	1
some	1
resemblance	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
she	1
turned	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
daughter,	1
she	1
could	1
almost	1
have	1
joined	1
in	1
Maria's	1
astonishment	1
at	1
her	1
being	1
so	1
thin	1
and	1
so	1
small.	1
There	1
was	1
neither	1
in	1
figure	1
nor	1
face	1
any	1
likeness	1
between	1
the	1
ladies.	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
was	1
pale	1
and	1
sickly;	1
her	1
features,	1
though	1
not	1
plain,	1
were	1
insignificant;	1
and	1
she	1
spoke	1
very	1
little,	1
except	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Jenkinson,	1
in	1
whose	1
appearance	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
remarkable,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
entirely	1
engaged	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
what	1
she	1
said,	1
and	1
placing	1
a	1
screen	1
in	1
the	1
proper	1
direction	1
before	1
her	1
eyes.	1
After	1
sitting	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
sent	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
windows	1
to	1
admire	1
the	1
view,	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
attending	1
them	1
to	1
point	1
out	1
its	1
beauties,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
kindly	1
informing	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
much	1
better	1
worth	1
looking	1
at	1
in	1
the	1
summer.	1
The	1
dinner	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
handsome,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
plate	1
which	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
had	1
promised;	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
likewise	1
foretold,	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
seat	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
by	1
her	1
ladyship's	1
desire,	1
and	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
life	1
could	1
furnish	1
nothing	1
greater.	1
He	1
carved,	1
and	1
ate,	1
and	1
praised	1
with	1
delighted	1
alacrity;	1
and	1
every	1
dish	1
was	1
commended,	1
first	1
by	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
by	1
Sir	1
William,	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
enough	1
recovered	1
to	1
echo	1
whatever	1
his	1
son-in-law	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
which	1
Elizabeth	1
wondered	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
could	1
bear.	1
But	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
seemed	1
gratified	1
by	1
their	1
excessive	1
admiration,	1
and	1
gave	1
most	1
gracious	1
smiles,	1
especially	1
when	1
any	1
dish	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
proved	1
a	1
novelty	1
to	1
them.	1
The	1
party	1
did	1
not	1
supply	1
much	1
conversation.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
speak	1
whenever	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
opening,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
seated	1
between	1
Charlotte	1
and	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh--the	1
former	1
of	1
whom	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
Lady	1
Catherine,	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
said	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
her	1
all	1
dinner-time.	1
Mrs.	1
Jenkinson	1
was	1
chiefly	1
employed	1
in	1
watching	1
how	1
little	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
ate,	1
pressing	1
her	1
to	1
try	1
some	1
other	1
dish,	1
and	1
fearing	1
she	1
was	1
indisposed.	1
Maria	1
thought	1
speaking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question,	1
and	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
did	1
nothing	1
but	1
eat	1
and	1
admire.	1
When	1
the	1
ladies	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
there	1
was	1
little	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
but	1
to	1
hear	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
talk,	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
without	1
any	1
intermission	1
till	1
coffee	1
came	1
in,	1
delivering	1
her	1
opinion	1
on	1
every	1
subject	1
in	1
so	1
decisive	1
a	1
manner,	1
as	1
proved	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
judgement	1
controverted.	1
She	1
inquired	1
into	1
Charlotte's	1
domestic	1
concerns	1
familiarly	1
and	1
minutely,	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
advice	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
them	1
all;	1
told	1
her	1
how	1
everything	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
regulated	1
in	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
family	1
as	1
hers,	1
and	1
instructed	1
her	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
her	1
cows	1
and	1
her	1
poultry.	1
Elizabeth	1
found	1
that	1
nothing	1
was	1
beneath	1
this	1
great	1
lady's	1
attention,	1
which	1
could	1
furnish	1
her	1
with	1
an	1
occasion	1
of	1
dictating	1
to	1
others.	1
In	1
the	1
intervals	1
of	1
her	1
discourse	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Collins,	1
she	1
addressed	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
questions	1
to	1
Maria	1
and	1
Elizabeth,	1
but	1
especially	1
to	1
the	1
latter,	1
of	1
whose	1
connections	1
she	1
knew	1
the	1
least,	1
and	1
who	1
she	1
observed	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Collins	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
genteel,	1
pretty	1
kind	1
of	1
girl.	1
She	1
asked	1
her,	1
at	1
different	1
times,	1
how	1
many	1
sisters	1
she	1
had,	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
older	1
or	1
younger	1
than	1
herself,	1
whether	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
married,	1
whether	1
they	1
were	1
handsome,	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
educated,	1
what	1
carriage	1
her	1
father	1
kept,	1
and	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
mother's	1
maiden	1
name?	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
impertinence	1
of	1
her	1
questions	1
but	1
answered	1
them	1
very	1
composedly.	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
then	1
observed,	1
"Your	1
father's	1
estate	1
is	1
entailed	1
on	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
I	1
think.	1
For	1
your	1
sake,"	1
turning	1
to	1
Charlotte,	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
it;	1
but	1
otherwise	1
I	1
see	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
entailing	1
estates	1
from	1
the	1
female	1
line.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
thought	1
necessary	1
in	1
Sir	1
Lewis	1
de	1
Bourgh's	1
family.	1
Do	1
you	1
play	1
and	1
sing,	1
Miss	1
Bennet?"	1
"A	1
little."	1
"Oh!	1
then--some	1
time	1
or	1
other	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1
to	1
hear	1
you.	1
Our	1
instrument	1
is	1
a	1
capital	1
one,	1
probably	1
superior	1
to----You	1
shall	1
try	1
it	1
some	1
day.	1
Do	1
your	1
sisters	1
play	1
and	1
sing?"	1
"One	1
of	1
them	1
does."	1
"Why	1
did	1
not	1
you	1
all	1
learn?	1
You	1
ought	1
all	1
to	1
have	1
learned.	1
The	1
Miss	1
Webbs	1
all	1
play,	1
and	1
their	1
father	1
has	1
not	1
so	1
good	1
an	1
income	1
as	1
yours.	1
Do	1
you	1
draw?"	1
"No,	1
not	1
at	1
all."	1
"What,	1
none	1
of	1
you?"	1
"Not	1
one."	1
"That	1
is	1
very	1
strange.	1
But	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
had	1
no	1
opportunity.	1
Your	1
mother	1
should	1
have	1
taken	1
you	1
to	1
town	1
every	1
spring	1
for	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
masters."	1
"My	1
mother	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
objection,	1
but	1
my	1
father	1
hates	1
London."	1
"Has	1
your	1
governess	1
left	1
you?"	1
"We	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
governess."	1
"No	1
governess!	1
How	1
was	1
that	1
possible?	1
Five	1
daughters	1
brought	1
up	1
at	1
home	1
without	1
a	1
governess!	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing.	1
Your	1
mother	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
quite	1
a	1
slave	1
to	1
your	1
education."	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
hardly	1
help	1
smiling	1
as	1
she	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
the	1
case.	1
"Then,	1
who	1
taught	1
you?	1
who	1
attended	1
to	1
you?	1
Without	1
a	1
governess,	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
neglected."	1
"Compared	1
with	1
some	1
families,	1
I	1
believe	1
we	1
were;	1
but	1
such	1
of	1
us	1
as	1
wished	1
to	1
learn	1
never	1
wanted	1
the	1
means.	1
We	1
were	1
always	1
encouraged	1
to	1
read,	1
and	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
masters	1
that	1
were	1
necessary.	1
Those	1
who	1
chose	1
to	1
be	1
idle,	1
certainly	1
might."	1
"Aye,	1
no	1
doubt;	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
a	1
governess	1
will	1
prevent,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
known	1
your	1
mother,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
advised	1
her	1
most	1
strenuously	1
to	1
engage	1
one.	1
I	1
always	1
say	1
that	1
nothing	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
education	1
without	1
steady	1
and	1
regular	1
instruction,	1
and	1
nobody	1
but	1
a	1
governess	1
can	1
give	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
wonderful	1
how	1
many	1
families	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
supplying	1
in	1
that	1
way.	1
I	1
am	1
always	1
glad	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
young	1
person	1
well	1
placed	1
out.	1
Four	1
nieces	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Jenkinson	1
are	1
most	1
delightfully	1
situated	1
through	1
my	1
means;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
recommended	1
another	1
young	1
person,	1
who	1
was	1
merely	1
accidentally	1
mentioned	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
family	1
are	1
quite	1
delighted	1
with	1
her.	1
Mrs.	1
Collins,	1
did	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
Lady	1
Metcalf's	1
calling	1
yesterday	1
to	1
thank	1
me?	1
She	1
finds	1
Miss	1
Pope	1
a	1
treasure.	1
'Lady	1
Catherine,'	1
said	1
she,	1
'you	1
have	1
given	1
me	1
a	1
treasure.'	1
Are	1
any	1
of	1
your	1
younger	1
sisters	1
out,	1
Miss	1
Bennet?"	1
"Yes,	1
ma'am,	1
all."	1
"All!	1
What,	1
all	1
five	1
out	1
at	1
once?	1
Very	1
odd!	1
And	1
you	1
only	1
the	1
second.	1
The	1
younger	1
ones	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
elder	1
ones	1
are	1
married!	1
Your	1
younger	1
sisters	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
young?"	1
"Yes,	1
my	1
youngest	1
is	1
not	1
sixteen.	1
Perhaps	1
_she_	1
is	1
full	1
young	1
to	1
be	1
much	1
in	1
company.	1
But	1
really,	1
ma'am,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
hard	1
upon	1
younger	1
sisters,	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
their	1
share	1
of	1
society	1
and	1
amusement,	1
because	1
the	1
elder	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
the	1
means	1
or	1
inclination	1
to	1
marry	1
early.	1
The	1
last-born	1
has	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
youth	1
at	1
the	1
first.	1
And	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
back	1
on	1
_such_	1
a	1
motive!	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
very	1
likely	1
to	1
promote	1
sisterly	1
affection	1
or	1
delicacy	1
of	1
mind."	1
"Upon	1
my	1
word,"	1
said	1
her	1
ladyship,	1
"you	1
give	1
your	1
opinion	1
very	1
decidedly	1
for	1
so	1
young	1
a	1
person.	1
Pray,	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
age?"	1
"With	1
three	1
younger	1
sisters	1
grown	1
up,"	1
replied	1
Elizabeth,	1
smiling,	1
"your	1
ladyship	1
can	1
hardly	1
expect	1
me	1
to	1
own	1
it."	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
seemed	1
quite	1
astonished	1
at	1
not	1
receiving	1
a	1
direct	1
answer;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
suspected	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
creature	1
who	1
had	1
ever	1
dared	1
to	1
trifle	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
dignified	1
impertinence.	1
"You	1
cannot	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
twenty,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
therefore	1
you	1
need	1
not	1
conceal	1
your	1
age."	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
one-and-twenty."	1
When	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
had	1
joined	1
them,	1
and	1
tea	1
was	1
over,	1
the	1
card-tables	1
were	1
placed.	1
Lady	1
Catherine,	1
Sir	1
William,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Collins	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
quadrille;	1
and	1
as	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
chose	1
to	1
play	1
at	1
cassino,	1
the	1
two	1
girls	1
had	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
assisting	1
Mrs.	1
Jenkinson	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
her	1
party.	1
Their	1
table	1
was	1
superlatively	1
stupid.	1
Scarcely	1
a	1
syllable	1
was	1
uttered	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
relate	1
to	1
the	1
game,	1
except	1
when	1
Mrs.	1
Jenkinson	1
expressed	1
her	1
fears	1
of	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh's	1
being	1
too	1
hot	1
or	1
too	1
cold,	1
or	1
having	1
too	1
much	1
or	1
too	1
little	1
light.	1
A	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
passed	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
table.	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
was	1
generally	1
speaking--stating	1
the	1
mistakes	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
others,	1
or	1
relating	1
some	1
anecdote	1
of	1
herself.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
was	1
employed	1
in	1
agreeing	1
to	1
everything	1
her	1
ladyship	1
said,	1
thanking	1
her	1
for	1
every	1
fish	1
he	1
won,	1
and	1
apologising	1
if	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
won	1
too	1
many.	1
Sir	1
William	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
much.	1
He	1
was	1
storing	1
his	1
memory	1
with	1
anecdotes	1
and	1
noble	1
names.	1
When	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
had	1
played	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
chose,	1
the	1
tables	1
were	1
broken	1
up,	1
the	1
carriage	1
was	1
offered	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Collins,	1
gratefully	1
accepted	1
and	1
immediately	1
ordered.	1
The	1
party	1
then	1
gathered	1
round	1
the	1
fire	1
to	1
hear	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
determine	1
what	1
weather	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
have	1
on	1
the	1
morrow.	1
From	1
these	1
instructions	1
they	1
were	1
summoned	1
by	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
coach;	1
and	1
with	1
many	1
speeches	1
of	1
thankfulness	1
on	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
side	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
bows	1
on	1
Sir	1
William's	1
they	1
departed.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
driven	1
from	1
the	1
door,	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
called	1
on	1
by	1
her	1
cousin	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
opinion	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
at	1
Rosings,	1
which,	1
for	1
Charlotte's	1
sake,	1
she	1
made	1
more	1
favourable	1
than	1
it	1
really	1
was.	1
But	1
her	1
commendation,	1
though	1
costing	1
her	1
some	1
trouble,	1
could	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
satisfy	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
soon	1
obliged	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
ladyship's	1
praise	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
hands.	1
Chapter	1
30	1
Sir	1
William	1
stayed	1
only	1
a	1
week	1
at	1
Hunsford,	1
but	1
his	1
visit	1
was	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
convince	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
daughter's	1
being	1
most	1
comfortably	1
settled,	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
possessing	1
such	1
a	1
husband	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
neighbour	1
as	1
were	1
not	1
often	1
met	1
with.	1
While	1
Sir	1
William	1
was	1
with	1
them,	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
devoted	1
his	1
morning	1
to	1
driving	1
him	1
out	1
in	1
his	1
gig,	1
and	1
showing	1
him	1
the	1
country;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
away,	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
usual	1
employments,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
thankful	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
more	1
of	1
her	1
cousin	1
by	1
the	1
alteration,	1
for	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
between	1
breakfast	1
and	1
dinner	1
was	1
now	1
passed	1
by	1
him	1
either	1
at	1
work	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
or	1
in	1
reading	1
and	1
writing,	1
and	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
book-room,	1
which	1
fronted	1
the	1
road.	1
The	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
ladies	1
sat	1
was	1
backwards.	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
at	1
first	1
rather	1
wondered	1
that	1
Charlotte	1
should	1
not	1
prefer	1
the	1
dining-parlour	1
for	1
common	1
use;	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
better	1
sized	1
room,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
more	1
pleasant	1
aspect;	1
but	1
she	1
soon	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
friend	1
had	1
an	1
excellent	1
reason	1
for	1
what	1
she	1
did,	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
would	1
undoubtedly	1
have	1
been	1
much	1
less	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
apartment,	1
had	1
they	1
sat	1
in	1
one	1
equally	1
lively;	1
and	1
she	1
gave	1
Charlotte	1
credit	1
for	1
the	1
arrangement.	1
From	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
they	1
could	1
distinguish	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
lane,	1
and	1
were	1
indebted	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
for	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
what	1
carriages	1
went	1
along,	1
and	1
how	1
often	1
especially	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
drove	1
by	1
in	1
her	1
phaeton,	1
which	1
he	1
never	1
failed	1
coming	1
to	1
inform	1
them	1
of,	1
though	1
it	1
happened	1
almost	1
every	1
day.	1
She	1
not	1
unfrequently	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
Parsonage,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
few	1
minutes'	1
conversation	1
with	1
Charlotte,	1
but	1
was	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
prevailed	1
upon	1
to	1
get	1
out.	1
Very	1
few	1
days	1
passed	1
in	1
which	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
did	1
not	1
walk	1
to	1
Rosings,	1
and	1
not	1
many	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
wife	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
go	1
likewise;	1
and	1
till	1
Elizabeth	1
recollected	1
that	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
other	1
family	1
livings	1
to	1
be	1
disposed	1
of,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
understand	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
hours.	1
Now	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
were	1
honoured	1
with	1
a	1
call	1
from	1
her	1
ladyship,	1
and	1
nothing	1
escaped	1
her	1
observation	1
that	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
during	1
these	1
visits.	1
She	1
examined	1
into	1
their	1
employments,	1
looked	1
at	1
their	1
work,	1
and	1
advised	1
them	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
differently;	1
found	1
fault	1
with	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
the	1
furniture;	1
or	1
detected	1
the	1
housemaid	1
in	1
negligence;	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
accepted	1
any	1
refreshment,	1
seemed	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
finding	1
out	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Collins's	1
joints	1
of	1
meat	1
were	1
too	1
large	1
for	1
her	1
family.	1
Elizabeth	1
soon	1
perceived,	1
that	1
though	1
this	1
great	1
lady	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
commission	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
the	1
county,	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
active	1
magistrate	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
parish,	1
the	1
minutest	1
concerns	1
of	1
which	1
were	1
carried	1
to	1
her	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Collins;	1
and	1
whenever	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
cottagers	1
were	1
disposed	1
to	1
be	1
quarrelsome,	1
discontented,	1
or	1
too	1
poor,	1
she	1
sallied	1
forth	1
into	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
settle	1
their	1
differences,	1
silence	1
their	1
complaints,	1
and	1
scold	1
them	1
into	1
harmony	1
and	1
plenty.	1
The	1
entertainment	1
of	1
dining	1
at	1
Rosings	1
was	1
repeated	1
about	1
twice	1
a	1
week;	1
and,	1
allowing	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Sir	1
William,	1
and	1
there	1
being	1
only	1
one	1
card-table	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
every	1
such	1
entertainment	1
was	1
the	1
counterpart	1
of	1
the	1
first.	1
Their	1
other	1
engagements	1
were	1
few,	1
as	1
the	1
style	1
of	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
in	1
general	1
was	1
beyond	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
reach.	1
This,	1
however,	1
was	1
no	1
evil	1
to	1
Elizabeth,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
she	1
spent	1
her	1
time	1
comfortably	1
enough;	1
there	1
were	1
half-hours	1
of	1
pleasant	1
conversation	1
with	1
Charlotte,	1
and	1
the	1
weather	1
was	1
so	1
fine	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
year	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
often	1
great	1
enjoyment	1
out	1
of	1
doors.	1
Her	1
favourite	1
walk,	1
and	1
where	1
she	1
frequently	1
went	1
while	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
calling	1
on	1
Lady	1
Catherine,	1
was	1
along	1
the	1
open	1
grove	1
which	1
edged	1
that	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
park,	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
nice	1
sheltered	1
path,	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
seemed	1
to	1
value	1
but	1
herself,	1
and	1
where	1
she	1
felt	1
beyond	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine's	1
curiosity.	1
In	1
this	1
quiet	1
way,	1
the	1
first	1
fortnight	1
of	1
her	1
visit	1
soon	1
passed	1
away.	1
Easter	1
was	1
approaching,	1
and	1
the	1
week	1
preceding	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
bring	1
an	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
family	1
at	1
Rosings,	1
which	1
in	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
circle	1
must	1
be	1
important.	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
heard	1
soon	1
after	1
her	1
arrival	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
was	1
expected	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
weeks,	1
and	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
many	1
of	1
her	1
acquaintances	1
whom	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
prefer,	1
his	1
coming	1
would	1
furnish	1
one	1
comparatively	1
new	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
in	1
their	1
Rosings	1
parties,	1
and	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
amused	1
in	1
seeing	1
how	1
hopeless	1
Miss	1
Bingley's	1
designs	1
on	1
him	1
were,	1
by	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
his	1
cousin,	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
evidently	1
destined	1
by	1
Lady	1
Catherine,	1
who	1
talked	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
satisfaction,	1
spoke	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
terms	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
admiration,	1
and	1
seemed	1
almost	1
angry	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
been	1
frequently	1
seen	1
by	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
and	1
herself.	1
His	1
arrival	1
was	1
soon	1
known	1
at	1
the	1
Parsonage;	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
was	1
walking	1
the	1
whole	1
morning	1
within	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
lodges	1
opening	1
into	1
Hunsford	1
Lane,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
earliest	1
assurance	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
after	1
making	1
his	1
bow	1
as	1
the	1
carriage	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
Park,	1
hurried	1
home	1
with	1
the	1
great	1
intelligence.	1
On	1
the	1
following	1
morning	1
he	1
hastened	1
to	1
Rosings	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
respects.	1
There	1
were	1
two	1
nephews	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
to	1
require	1
them,	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam,	1
the	1
younger	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
uncle	1
Lord	1
----,	1
and,	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
surprise	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
party,	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
returned,	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
accompanied	1
him.	1
Charlotte	1
had	1
seen	1
them	1
from	1
her	1
husband's	1
room,	1
crossing	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
immediately	1
running	1
into	1
the	1
other,	1
told	1
the	1
girls	1
what	1
an	1
honour	1
they	1
might	1
expect,	1
adding:	1
"I	1
may	1
thank	1
you,	1
Eliza,	1
for	1
this	1
piece	1
of	1
civility.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
come	1
so	1
soon	1
to	1
wait	1
upon	1
me."	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
scarcely	1
time	1
to	1
disclaim	1
all	1
right	1
to	1
the	1
compliment,	1
before	1
their	1
approach	1
was	1
announced	1
by	1
the	1
door-bell,	1
and	1
shortly	1
afterwards	1
the	1
three	1
gentlemen	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam,	1
who	1
led	1
the	1
way,	1
was	1
about	1
thirty,	1
not	1
handsome,	1
but	1
in	1
person	1
and	1
address	1
most	1
truly	1
the	1
gentleman.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
looked	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
look	1
in	1
Hertfordshire--paid	1
his	1
compliments,	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
reserve,	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Collins,	1
and	1
whatever	1
might	1
be	1
his	1
feelings	1
toward	1
her	1
friend,	1
met	1
her	1
with	1
every	1
appearance	1
of	1
composure.	1
Elizabeth	1
merely	1
curtseyed	1
to	1
him	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word.	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
entered	1
into	1
conversation	1
directly	1
with	1
the	1
readiness	1
and	1
ease	1
of	1
a	1
well-bred	1
man,	1
and	1
talked	1
very	1
pleasantly;	1
but	1
his	1
cousin,	1
after	1
having	1
addressed	1
a	1
slight	1
observation	1
on	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
garden	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Collins,	1
sat	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
without	1
speaking	1
to	1
anybody.	1
At	1
length,	1
however,	1
his	1
civility	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
awakened	1
as	1
to	1
inquire	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
after	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
her	1
family.	1
She	1
answered	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
usual	1
way,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
moment's	1
pause,	1
added:	1
"My	1
eldest	1
sister	1
has	1
been	1
in	1
town	1
these	1
three	1
months.	1
Have	1
you	1
never	1
happened	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
there?"	1
She	1
was	1
perfectly	1
sensible	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
had;	1
but	1
she	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
betray	1
any	1
consciousness	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
the	1
Bingleys	1
and	1
Jane,	1
and	1
she	1
thought	1
he	1
looked	1
a	1
little	1
confused	1
as	1
he	1
answered	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
so	1
fortunate	1
as	1
to	1
meet	1
Miss	1
Bennet.	1
The	1
subject	1
was	1
pursued	1
no	1
farther,	1
and	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
went	1
away.	1
Chapter	1
31	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam's	1
manners	1
were	1
very	1
much	1
admired	1
at	1
the	1
Parsonage,	1
and	1
the	1
ladies	1
all	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
add	1
considerably	1
to	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
their	1
engagements	1
at	1
Rosings.	1
It	1
was	1
some	1
days,	1
however,	1
before	1
they	1
received	1
any	1
invitation	1
thither--for	1
while	1
there	1
were	1
visitors	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
necessary;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
till	1
Easter-day,	1
almost	1
a	1
week	1
after	1
the	1
gentlemen's	1
arrival,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
honoured	1
by	1
such	1
an	1
attention,	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
were	1
merely	1
asked	1
on	1
leaving	1
church	1
to	1
come	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
evening.	1
For	1
the	1
last	1
week	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
very	1
little	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
or	1
her	1
daughter.	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
had	1
called	1
at	1
the	1
Parsonage	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
during	1
the	1
time,	1
but	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
only	1
at	1
church.	1
The	1
invitation	1
was	1
accepted	1
of	1
course,	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
proper	1
hour	1
they	1
joined	1
the	1
party	1
in	1
Lady	1
Catherine's	1
drawing-room.	1
Her	1
ladyship	1
received	1
them	1
civilly,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
their	1
company	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
so	1
acceptable	1
as	1
when	1
she	1
could	1
get	1
nobody	1
else;	1
and	1
she	1
was,	1
in	1
fact,	1
almost	1
engrossed	1
by	1
her	1
nephews,	1
speaking	1
to	1
them,	1
especially	1
to	1
Darcy,	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
seemed	1
really	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
them;	1
anything	1
was	1
a	1
welcome	1
relief	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
Rosings;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Collins's	1
pretty	1
friend	1
had	1
moreover	1
caught	1
his	1
fancy	1
very	1
much.	1
He	1
now	1
seated	1
himself	1
by	1
her,	1
and	1
talked	1
so	1
agreeably	1
of	1
Kent	1
and	1
Hertfordshire,	1
of	1
travelling	1
and	1
staying	1
at	1
home,	1
of	1
new	1
books	1
and	1
music,	1
that	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
half	1
so	1
well	1
entertained	1
in	1
that	1
room	1
before;	1
and	1
they	1
conversed	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
spirit	1
and	1
flow,	1
as	1
to	1
draw	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
herself,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy.	1
_His_	1
eyes	1
had	1
been	1
soon	1
and	1
repeatedly	1
turned	1
towards	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
curiosity;	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
ladyship,	1
after	1
a	1
while,	1
shared	1
the	1
feeling,	1
was	1
more	1
openly	1
acknowledged,	1
for	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
scruple	1
to	1
call	1
out:	1
"What	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
saying,	1
Fitzwilliam?	1
What	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
are	1
talking	1
of?	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
telling	1
Miss	1
Bennet?	1
Let	1
me	1
hear	1
what	1
it	1
is."	1
"We	1
are	1
speaking	1
of	1
music,	1
madam,"	1
said	1
he,	1
when	1
no	1
longer	1
able	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
reply.	1
"Of	1
music!	1
Then	1
pray	1
speak	1
aloud.	1
It	1
is	1
of	1
all	1
subjects	1
my	1
delight.	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
my	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
speaking	1
of	1
music.	1
There	1
are	1
few	1
people	1
in	1
England,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
who	1
have	1
more	1
true	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
music	1
than	1
myself,	1
or	1
a	1
better	1
natural	1
taste.	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
learnt,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
proficient.	1
And	1
so	1
would	1
Anne,	1
if	1
her	1
health	1
had	1
allowed	1
her	1
to	1
apply.	1
I	1
am	1
confident	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
performed	1
delightfully.	1
How	1
does	1
Georgiana	1
get	1
on,	1
Darcy?"	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
spoke	1
with	1
affectionate	1
praise	1
of	1
his	1
sister's	1
proficiency.	1
"I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
hear	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
account	1
of	1
her,"	1
said	1
Lady	1
Catherine;	1
"and	1
pray	1
tell	1
her	1
from	1
me,	1
that	1
she	1
cannot	1
expect	1
to	1
excel	1
if	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
practice	1
a	1
good	1
deal."	1
"I	1
assure	1
you,	1
madam,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
"that	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
need	1
such	1
advice.	1
She	1
practises	1
very	1
constantly."	1
"So	1
much	1
the	1
better.	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
done	1
too	1
much;	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
next	1
write	1
to	1
her,	1
I	1
shall	1
charge	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
neglect	1
it	1
on	1
any	1
account.	1
I	1
often	1
tell	1
young	1
ladies	1
that	1
no	1
excellence	1
in	1
music	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
acquired	1
without	1
constant	1
practice.	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
several	1
times,	1
that	1
she	1
will	1
never	1
play	1
really	1
well	1
unless	1
she	1
practises	1
more;	1
and	1
though	1
Mrs.	1
Collins	1
has	1
no	1
instrument,	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
welcome,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
often	1
told	1
her,	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Rosings	1
every	1
day,	1
and	1
play	1
on	1
the	1
pianoforte	1
in	1
Mrs.	1
Jenkinson's	1
room.	1
She	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
nobody's	1
way,	1
you	1
know,	1
in	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
house."	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
looked	1
a	1
little	1
ashamed	1
of	1
his	1
aunt's	1
ill-breeding,	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
answer.	1
When	1
coffee	1
was	1
over,	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
reminded	1
Elizabeth	1
of	1
having	1
promised	1
to	1
play	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
directly	1
to	1
the	1
instrument.	1
He	1
drew	1
a	1
chair	1
near	1
her.	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
listened	1
to	1
half	1
a	1
song,	1
and	1
then	1
talked,	1
as	1
before,	1
to	1
her	1
other	1
nephew;	1
till	1
the	1
latter	1
walked	1
away	1
from	1
her,	1
and	1
making	1
with	1
his	1
usual	1
deliberation	1
towards	1
the	1
pianoforte	1
stationed	1
himself	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
command	1
a	1
full	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
performer's	1
countenance.	1
Elizabeth	1
saw	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
convenient	1
pause,	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
arch	1
smile,	1
and	1
said:	1
"You	1
mean	1
to	1
frighten	1
me,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
by	1
coming	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
state	1
to	1
hear	1
me?	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
alarmed	1
though	1
your	1
sister	1
_does_	1
play	1
so	1
well.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
stubbornness	1
about	1
me	1
that	1
never	1
can	1
bear	1
to	1
be	1
frightened	1
at	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
others.	1
My	1
courage	1
always	1
rises	1
at	1
every	1
attempt	1
to	1
intimidate	1
me."	1
"I	1
shall	1
not	1
say	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
"because	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
really	1
believe	1
me	1
to	1
entertain	1
any	1
design	1
of	1
alarming	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
your	1
acquaintance	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
find	1
great	1
enjoyment	1
in	1
occasionally	1
professing	1
opinions	1
which	1
in	1
fact	1
are	1
not	1
your	1
own."	1
Elizabeth	1
laughed	1
heartily	1
at	1
this	1
picture	1
of	1
herself,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam,	1
"Your	1
cousin	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
notion	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
teach	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
believe	1
a	1
word	1
I	1
say.	1
I	1
am	1
particularly	1
unlucky	1
in	1
meeting	1
with	1
a	1
person	1
so	1
able	1
to	1
expose	1
my	1
real	1
character,	1
in	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
where	1
I	1
had	1
hoped	1
to	1
pass	1
myself	1
off	1
with	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
credit.	1
Indeed,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
ungenerous	1
in	1
you	1
to	1
mention	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
knew	1
to	1
my	1
disadvantage	1
in	1
Hertfordshire--and,	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
say,	1
very	1
impolitic	1
too--for	1
it	1
is	1
provoking	1
me	1
to	1
retaliate,	1
and	1
such	1
things	1
may	1
come	1
out	1
as	1
will	1
shock	1
your	1
relations	1
to	1
hear."	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
you,"	1
said	1
he,	1
smilingly.	1
"Pray	1
let	1
me	1
hear	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
accuse	1
him	1
of,"	1
cried	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam.	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
he	1
behaves	1
among	1
strangers."	1
"You	1
shall	1
hear	1
then--but	1
prepare	1
yourself	1
for	1
something	1
very	1
dreadful.	1
The	1
first	1
time	1
of	1
my	1
ever	1
seeing	1
him	1
in	1
Hertfordshire,	1
you	1
must	1
know,	1
was	1
at	1
a	1
ball--and	1
at	1
this	1
ball,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
he	1
did?	1
He	1
danced	1
only	1
four	1
dances,	1
though	1
gentlemen	1
were	1
scarce;	1
and,	1
to	1
my	1
certain	1
knowledge,	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
young	1
lady	1
was	1
sitting	1
down	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
partner.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
you	1
cannot	1
deny	1
the	1
fact."	1
"I	1
had	1
not	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
knowing	1
any	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
assembly	1
beyond	1
my	1
own	1
party."	1
"True;	1
and	1
nobody	1
can	1
ever	1
be	1
introduced	1
in	1
a	1
ball-room.	1
Well,	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam,	1
what	1
do	1
I	1
play	1
next?	1
My	1
fingers	1
wait	1
your	1
orders."	1
"Perhaps,"	1
said	1
Darcy,	1
"I	1
should	1
have	1
judged	1
better,	1
had	1
I	1
sought	1
an	1
introduction;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
ill-qualified	1
to	1
recommend	1
myself	1
to	1
strangers."	1
"Shall	1
we	1
ask	1
your	1
cousin	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
this?"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
still	1
addressing	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam.	1
"Shall	1
we	1
ask	1
him	1
why	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
sense	1
and	1
education,	1
and	1
who	1
has	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
is	1
ill	1
qualified	1
to	1
recommend	1
himself	1
to	1
strangers?"	1
"I	1
can	1
answer	1
your	1
question,"	1
said	1
Fitzwilliam,	1
"without	1
applying	1
to	1
him.	1
It	1
is	1
because	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
give	1
himself	1
the	1
trouble."	1
"I	1
certainly	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
talent	1
which	1
some	1
people	1
possess,"	1
said	1
Darcy,	1
"of	1
conversing	1
easily	1
with	1
those	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
before.	1
I	1
cannot	1
catch	1
their	1
tone	1
of	1
conversation,	1
or	1
appear	1
interested	1
in	1
their	1
concerns,	1
as	1
I	1
often	1
see	1
done."	1
"My	1
fingers,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
"do	1
not	1
move	1
over	1
this	1
instrument	1
in	1
the	1
masterly	1
manner	1
which	1
I	1
see	1
so	1
many	1
women's	1
do.	1
They	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
force	1
or	1
rapidity,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
produce	1
the	1
same	1
expression.	1
But	1
then	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
supposed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
own	1
fault--because	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
practising.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
_my_	1
fingers	1
as	1
capable	1
as	1
any	1
other	1
woman's	1
of	1
superior	1
execution."	1
Darcy	1
smiled	1
and	1
said,	1
"You	1
are	1
perfectly	1
right.	1
You	1
have	1
employed	1
your	1
time	1
much	1
better.	1
No	1
one	1
admitted	1
to	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
hearing	1
you	1
can	1
think	1
anything	1
wanting.	1
We	1
neither	1
of	1
us	1
perform	1
to	1
strangers."	1
Here	1
they	1
were	1
interrupted	1
by	1
Lady	1
Catherine,	1
who	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
of.	1
Elizabeth	1
immediately	1
began	1
playing	1
again.	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
approached,	1
and,	1
after	1
listening	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
said	1
to	1
Darcy:	1
"Miss	1
Bennet	1
would	1
not	1
play	1
at	1
all	1
amiss	1
if	1
she	1
practised	1
more,	1
and	1
could	1
have	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
a	1
London	1
master.	1
She	1
has	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
notion	1
of	1
fingering,	1
though	1
her	1
taste	1
is	1
not	1
equal	1
to	1
Anne's.	1
Anne	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
delightful	1
performer,	1
had	1
her	1
health	1
allowed	1
her	1
to	1
learn."	1
Elizabeth	1
looked	1
at	1
Darcy	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
cordially	1
he	1
assented	1
to	1
his	1
cousin's	1
praise;	1
but	1
neither	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
nor	1
at	1
any	1
other	1
could	1
she	1
discern	1
any	1
symptom	1
of	1
love;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
she	1
derived	1
this	1
comfort	1
for	1
Miss	1
Bingley,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
just	1
as	1
likely	1
to	1
marry	1
_her_,	1
had	1
she	1
been	1
his	1
relation.	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
continued	1
her	1
remarks	1
on	1
Elizabeth's	1
performance,	1
mixing	1
with	1
them	1
many	1
instructions	1
on	1
execution	1
and	1
taste.	1
Elizabeth	1
received	1
them	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
forbearance	1
of	1
civility,	1
and,	1
at	1
the	1
request	1
of	1
the	1
gentlemen,	1
remained	1
at	1
the	1
instrument	1
till	1
her	1
ladyship's	1
carriage	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
all	1
home.	1
Chapter	1
32	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
sitting	1
by	1
herself	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
and	1
writing	1
to	1
Jane	1
while	1
Mrs.	1
Collins	1
and	1
Maria	1
were	1
gone	1
on	1
business	1
into	1
the	1
village,	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
startled	1
by	1
a	1
ring	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
the	1
certain	1
signal	1
of	1
a	1
visitor.	1
As	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
no	1
carriage,	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
not	1
unlikely	1
to	1
be	1
Lady	1
Catherine,	1
and	1
under	1
that	1
apprehension	1
was	1
putting	1
away	1
her	1
half-finished	1
letter	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
escape	1
all	1
impertinent	1
questions,	1
when	1
the	1
door	1
opened,	1
and,	1
to	1
her	1
very	1
great	1
surprise,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
only,	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
He	1
seemed	1
astonished	1
too	1
on	1
finding	1
her	1
alone,	1
and	1
apologised	1
for	1
his	1
intrusion	1
by	1
letting	1
her	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
understood	1
all	1
the	1
ladies	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
within.	1
They	1
then	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
when	1
her	1
inquiries	1
after	1
Rosings	1
were	1
made,	1
seemed	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
sinking	1
into	1
total	1
silence.	1
It	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
something,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
emergence	1
recollecting	1
_when_	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
last	1
in	1
Hertfordshire,	1
and	1
feeling	1
curious	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
their	1
hasty	1
departure,	1
she	1
observed:	1
"How	1
very	1
suddenly	1
you	1
all	1
quitted	1
Netherfield	1
last	1
November,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy!	1
It	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
most	1
agreeable	1
surprise	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
all	1
after	1
him	1
so	1
soon;	1
for,	1
if	1
I	1
recollect	1
right,	1
he	1
went	1
but	1
the	1
day	1
before.	1
He	1
and	1
his	1
sisters	1
were	1
well,	1
I	1
hope,	1
when	1
you	1
left	1
London?"	1
"Perfectly	1
so,	1
I	1
thank	1
you."	1
She	1
found	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
receive	1
no	1
other	1
answer,	1
and,	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
pause	1
added:	1
"I	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
understood	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
has	1
not	1
much	1
idea	1
of	1
ever	1
returning	1
to	1
Netherfield	1
again?"	1
"I	1
have	1
never	1
heard	1
him	1
say	1
so;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
spend	1
very	1
little	1
of	1
his	1
time	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
future.	1
He	1
has	1
many	1
friends,	1
and	1
is	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
life	1
when	1
friends	1
and	1
engagements	1
are	1
continually	1
increasing."	1
"If	1
he	1
means	1
to	1
be	1
but	1
little	1
at	1
Netherfield,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
for	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
place	1
entirely,	1
for	1
then	1
we	1
might	1
possibly	1
get	1
a	1
settled	1
family	1
there.	1
But,	1
perhaps,	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
house	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
convenience	1
of	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
as	1
for	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
we	1
must	1
expect	1
him	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
or	1
quit	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
principle."	1
"I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
surprised,"	1
said	1
Darcy,	1
"if	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
up	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
any	1
eligible	1
purchase	1
offers."	1
Elizabeth	1
made	1
no	1
answer.	1
She	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
talking	1
longer	1
of	1
his	1
friend;	1
and,	1
having	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
say,	1
was	1
now	1
determined	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
finding	1
a	1
subject	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
hint,	1
and	1
soon	1
began	1
with,	1
"This	1
seems	1
a	1
very	1
comfortable	1
house.	1
Lady	1
Catherine,	1
I	1
believe,	1
did	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
it	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
first	1
came	1
to	1
Hunsford."	1
"I	1
believe	1
she	1
did--and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
bestowed	1
her	1
kindness	1
on	1
a	1
more	1
grateful	1
object."	1
"Mr.	1
Collins	1
appears	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
fortunate	1
in	1
his	1
choice	1
of	1
a	1
wife."	1
"Yes,	1
indeed,	1
his	1
friends	1
may	1
well	1
rejoice	1
in	1
his	1
having	1
met	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
few	1
sensible	1
women	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
accepted	1
him,	1
or	1
have	1
made	1
him	1
happy	1
if	1
they	1
had.	1
My	1
friend	1
has	1
an	1
excellent	1
understanding--though	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
certain	1
that	1
I	1
consider	1
her	1
marrying	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
as	1
the	1
wisest	1
thing	1
she	1
ever	1
did.	1
She	1
seems	1
perfectly	1
happy,	1
however,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
prudential	1
light	1
it	1
is	1
certainly	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
match	1
for	1
her."	1
"It	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
agreeable	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
settled	1
within	1
so	1
easy	1
a	1
distance	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
family	1
and	1
friends."	1
"An	1
easy	1
distance,	1
do	1
you	1
call	1
it?	1
It	1
is	1
nearly	1
fifty	1
miles."	1
"And	1
what	1
is	1
fifty	1
miles	1
of	1
good	1
road?	1
Little	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
day's	1
journey.	1
Yes,	1
I	1
call	1
it	1
a	1
_very_	1
easy	1
distance."	1
"I	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
considered	1
the	1
distance	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
_advantages_	1
of	1
the	1
match,"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth.	1
"I	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Collins	1
was	1
settled	1
_near_	1
her	1
family."	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
attachment	1
to	1
Hertfordshire.	1
Anything	1
beyond	1
the	1
very	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
Longbourn,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
would	1
appear	1
far."	1
As	1
he	1
spoke	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
smile	1
which	1
Elizabeth	1
fancied	1
she	1
understood;	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
supposing	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
thinking	1
of	1
Jane	1
and	1
Netherfield,	1
and	1
she	1
blushed	1
as	1
she	1
answered:	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
settled	1
too	1
near	1
her	1
family.	1
The	1
far	1
and	1
the	1
near	1
must	1
be	1
relative,	1
and	1
depend	1
on	1
many	1
varying	1
circumstances.	1
Where	1
there	1
is	1
fortune	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
expenses	1
of	1
travelling	1
unimportant,	1
distance	1
becomes	1
no	1
evil.	1
But	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
case	1
_here_.	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Collins	1
have	1
a	1
comfortable	1
income,	1
but	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
will	1
allow	1
of	1
frequent	1
journeys--and	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
my	1
friend	1
would	1
not	1
call	1
herself	1
_near_	1
her	1
family	1
under	1
less	1
than	1
_half_	1
the	1
present	1
distance."	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
drew	1
his	1
chair	1
a	1
little	1
towards	1
her,	1
and	1
said,	1
"_You_	1
cannot	1
have	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
such	1
very	1
strong	1
local	1
attachment.	1
_You_	1
cannot	1
have	1
been	1
always	1
at	1
Longbourn."	1
Elizabeth	1
looked	1
surprised.	1
The	1
gentleman	1
experienced	1
some	1
change	1
of	1
feeling;	1
he	1
drew	1
back	1
his	1
chair,	1
took	1
a	1
newspaper	1
from	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
glancing	1
over	1
it,	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
colder	1
voice:	1
"Are	1
you	1
pleased	1
with	1
Kent?"	1
A	1
short	1
dialogue	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
ensued,	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
calm	1
and	1
concise--and	1
soon	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
Charlotte	1
and	1
her	1
sister,	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
her	1
walk.	1
The	1
tete-a-tete	1
surprised	1
them.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
related	1
the	1
mistake	1
which	1
had	1
occasioned	1
his	1
intruding	1
on	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
and	1
after	1
sitting	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
longer	1
without	1
saying	1
much	1
to	1
anybody,	1
went	1
away.	1
"What	1
can	1
be	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
this?"	1
said	1
Charlotte,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
gone.	1
"My	1
dear,	1
Eliza,	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you,	1
or	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
called	1
us	1
in	1
this	1
familiar	1
way."	1
But	1
when	1
Elizabeth	1
told	1
of	1
his	1
silence;	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
very	1
likely,	1
even	1
to	1
Charlotte's	1
wishes,	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
case;	1
and	1
after	1
various	1
conjectures,	1
they	1
could	1
at	1
last	1
only	1
suppose	1
his	1
visit	1
to	1
proceed	1
from	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
finding	1
anything	1
to	1
do,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
probable	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
year.	1
All	1
field	1
sports	1
were	1
over.	1
Within	1
doors	1
there	1
was	1
Lady	1
Catherine,	1
books,	1
and	1
a	1
billiard-table,	1
but	1
gentlemen	1
cannot	1
always	1
be	1
within	1
doors;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
nearness	1
of	1
the	1
Parsonage,	1
or	1
the	1
pleasantness	1
of	1
the	1
walk	1
to	1
it,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
it,	1
the	1
two	1
cousins	1
found	1
a	1
temptation	1
from	1
this	1
period	1
of	1
walking	1
thither	1
almost	1
every	1
day.	1
They	1
called	1
at	1
various	1
times	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
sometimes	1
separately,	1
sometimes	1
together,	1
and	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
accompanied	1
by	1
their	1
aunt.	1
It	1
was	1
plain	1
to	1
them	1
all	1
that	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
came	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
pleasure	1
in	1
their	1
society,	1
a	1
persuasion	1
which	1
of	1
course	1
recommended	1
him	1
still	1
more;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
reminded	1
by	1
her	1
own	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
being	1
with	1
him,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
by	1
his	1
evident	1
admiration	1
of	1
her,	1
of	1
her	1
former	1
favourite	1
George	1
Wickham;	1
and	1
though,	1
in	1
comparing	1
them,	1
she	1
saw	1
there	1
was	1
less	1
captivating	1
softness	1
in	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam's	1
manners,	1
she	1
believed	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
the	1
best	1
informed	1
mind.	1
But	1
why	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
came	1
so	1
often	1
to	1
the	1
Parsonage,	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
difficult	1
to	1
understand.	1
It	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
for	1
society,	1
as	1
he	1
frequently	1
sat	1
there	1
ten	1
minutes	1
together	1
without	1
opening	1
his	1
lips;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
did	1
speak,	1
it	1
seemed	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
necessity	1
rather	1
than	1
of	1
choice--a	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
propriety,	1
not	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
himself.	1
He	1
seldom	1
appeared	1
really	1
animated.	1
Mrs.	1
Collins	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
him.	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam's	1
occasionally	1
laughing	1
at	1
his	1
stupidity,	1
proved	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
generally	1
different,	1
which	1
her	1
own	1
knowledge	1
of	1
him	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
told	1
her;	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
liked	1
to	1
have	1
believed	1
this	1
change	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
love,	1
and	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
that	1
love	1
her	1
friend	1
Eliza,	1
she	1
set	1
herself	1
seriously	1
to	1
work	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
out.	1
She	1
watched	1
him	1
whenever	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
Rosings,	1
and	1
whenever	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
Hunsford;	1
but	1
without	1
much	1
success.	1
He	1
certainly	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
friend	1
a	1
great	1
deal,	1
but	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
that	1
look	1
was	1
disputable.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
earnest,	1
steadfast	1
gaze,	1
but	1
she	1
often	1
doubted	1
whether	1
there	1
were	1
much	1
admiration	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
it	1
seemed	1
nothing	1
but	1
absence	1
of	1
mind.	1
She	1
had	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
suggested	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
partial	1
to	1
her,	1
but	1
Elizabeth	1
always	1
laughed	1
at	1
the	1
idea;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Collins	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
right	1
to	1
press	1
the	1
subject,	1
from	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
raising	1
expectations	1
which	1
might	1
only	1
end	1
in	1
disappointment;	1
for	1
in	1
her	1
opinion	1
it	1
admitted	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
doubt,	1
that	1
all	1
her	1
friend's	1
dislike	1
would	1
vanish,	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
suppose	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
her	1
power.	1
In	1
her	1
kind	1
schemes	1
for	1
Elizabeth,	1
she	1
sometimes	1
planned	1
her	1
marrying	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam.	1
He	1
was	1
beyond	1
comparison	1
the	1
most	1
pleasant	1
man;	1
he	1
certainly	1
admired	1
her,	1
and	1
his	1
situation	1
in	1
life	1
was	1
most	1
eligible;	1
but,	1
to	1
counterbalance	1
these	1
advantages,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
had	1
considerable	1
patronage	1
in	1
the	1
church,	1
and	1
his	1
cousin	1
could	1
have	1
none	1
at	1
all.	1
Chapter	1
33	1
More	1
than	1
once	1
did	1
Elizabeth,	1
in	1
her	1
ramble	1
within	1
the	1
park,	1
unexpectedly	1
meet	1
Mr.	1
Darcy.	1
She	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
perverseness	1
of	1
the	1
mischance	1
that	1
should	1
bring	1
him	1
where	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
was	1
brought,	1
and,	1
to	1
prevent	1
its	1
ever	1
happening	1
again,	1
took	1
care	1
to	1
inform	1
him	1
at	1
first	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
favourite	1
haunt	1
of	1
hers.	1
How	1
it	1
could	1
occur	1
a	1
second	1
time,	1
therefore,	1
was	1
very	1
odd!	1
Yet	1
it	1
did,	1
and	1
even	1
a	1
third.	1
It	1
seemed	1
like	1
wilful	1
ill-nature,	1
or	1
a	1
voluntary	1
penance,	1
for	1
on	1
these	1
occasions	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
merely	1
a	1
few	1
formal	1
inquiries	1
and	1
an	1
awkward	1
pause	1
and	1
then	1
away,	1
but	1
he	1
actually	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
turn	1
back	1
and	1
walk	1
with	1
her.	1
He	1
never	1
said	1
a	1
great	1
deal,	1
nor	1
did	1
she	1
give	1
herself	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
talking	1
or	1
of	1
listening	1
much;	1
but	1
it	1
struck	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
their	1
third	1
rencontre	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
asking	1
some	1
odd	1
unconnected	1
questions--about	1
her	1
pleasure	1
in	1
being	1
at	1
Hunsford,	1
her	1
love	1
of	1
solitary	1
walks,	1
and	1
her	1
opinion	1
of	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Collins's	1
happiness;	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
speaking	1
of	1
Rosings	1
and	1
her	1
not	1
perfectly	1
understanding	1
the	1
house,	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
expect	1
that	1
whenever	1
she	1
came	1
into	1
Kent	1
again	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
staying	1
_there_	1
too.	1
His	1
words	1
seemed	1
to	1
imply	1
it.	1
Could	1
he	1
have	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
in	1
his	1
thoughts?	1
She	1
supposed,	1
if	1
he	1
meant	1
anything,	1
he	1
must	1
mean	1
an	1
allusion	1
to	1
what	1
might	1
arise	1
in	1
that	1
quarter.	1
It	1
distressed	1
her	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
glad	1
to	1
find	1
herself	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
in	1
the	1
pales	1
opposite	1
the	1
Parsonage.	1
She	1
was	1
engaged	1
one	1
day	1
as	1
she	1
walked,	1
in	1
perusing	1
Jane's	1
last	1
letter,	1
and	1
dwelling	1
on	1
some	1
passages	1
which	1
proved	1
that	1
Jane	1
had	1
not	1
written	1
in	1
spirits,	1
when,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
again	1
surprised	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
she	1
saw	1
on	1
looking	1
up	1
that	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
was	1
meeting	1
her.	1
Putting	1
away	1
the	1
letter	1
immediately	1
and	1
forcing	1
a	1
smile,	1
she	1
said:	1
"I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
before	1
that	1
you	1
ever	1
walked	1
this	1
way."	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
making	1
the	1
tour	1
of	1
the	1
park,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
"as	1
I	1
generally	1
do	1
every	1
year,	1
and	1
intend	1
to	1
close	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
call	1
at	1
the	1
Parsonage.	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
much	1
farther?"	1
"No,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
turned	1
in	1
a	1
moment."	1
And	1
accordingly	1
she	1
did	1
turn,	1
and	1
they	1
walked	1
towards	1
the	1
Parsonage	1
together.	1
"Do	1
you	1
certainly	1
leave	1
Kent	1
on	1
Saturday?"	1
said	1
she.	1
"Yes--if	1
Darcy	1
does	1
not	1
put	1
it	1
off	1
again.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
at	1
his	1
disposal.	1
He	1
arranges	1
the	1
business	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
pleases."	1
"And	1
if	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
please	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
arrangement,	1
he	1
has	1
at	1
least	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
power	1
of	1
choice.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
anybody	1
who	1
seems	1
more	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
doing	1
what	1
he	1
likes	1
than	1
Mr.	1
Darcy."	1
"He	1
likes	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
own	1
way	1
very	1
well,"	1
replied	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam.	1
"But	1
so	1
we	1
all	1
do.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
better	1
means	1
of	1
having	1
it	1
than	1
many	1
others,	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
rich,	1
and	1
many	1
others	1
are	1
poor.	1
I	1
speak	1
feelingly.	1
A	1
younger	1
son,	1
you	1
know,	1
must	1
be	1
inured	1
to	1
self-denial	1
and	1
dependence."	1
"In	1
my	1
opinion,	1
the	1
younger	1
son	1
of	1
an	1
earl	1
can	1
know	1
very	1
little	1
of	1
either.	1
Now	1
seriously,	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
ever	1
known	1
of	1
self-denial	1
and	1
dependence?	1
When	1
have	1
you	1
been	1
prevented	1
by	1
want	1
of	1
money	1
from	1
going	1
wherever	1
you	1
chose,	1
or	1
procuring	1
anything	1
you	1
had	1
a	1
fancy	1
for?"	1
"These	1
are	1
home	1
questions--and	1
perhaps	1
I	1
cannot	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
experienced	1
many	1
hardships	1
of	1
that	1
nature.	1
But	1
in	1
matters	1
of	1
greater	1
weight,	1
I	1
may	1
suffer	1
from	1
want	1
of	1
money.	1
Younger	1
sons	1
cannot	1
marry	1
where	1
they	1
like."	1
"Unless	1
where	1
they	1
like	1
women	1
of	1
fortune,	1
which	1
I	1
think	1
they	1
very	1
often	1
do."	1
"Our	1
habits	1
of	1
expense	1
make	1
us	1
too	1
dependent,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
many	1
in	1
my	1
rank	1
of	1
life	1
who	1
can	1
afford	1
to	1
marry	1
without	1
some	1
attention	1
to	1
money."	1
"Is	1
this,"	1
thought	1
Elizabeth,	1
"meant	1
for	1
me?"	1
and	1
she	1
coloured	1
at	1
the	1
idea;	1
but,	1
recovering	1
herself,	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
lively	1
tone,	1
"And	1
pray,	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
usual	1
price	1
of	1
an	1
earl's	1
younger	1
son?	1
Unless	1
the	1
elder	1
brother	1
is	1
very	1
sickly,	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
ask	1
above	1
fifty	1
thousand	1
pounds."	1
He	1
answered	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
style,	1
and	1
the	1
subject	1
dropped.	1
To	1
interrupt	1
a	1
silence	1
which	1
might	1
make	1
him	1
fancy	1
her	1
affected	1
with	1
what	1
had	1
passed,	1
she	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
said:	1
"I	1
imagine	1
your	1
cousin	1
brought	1
you	1
down	1
with	1
him	1
chiefly	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
having	1
someone	1
at	1
his	1
disposal.	1
I	1
wonder	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
marry,	1
to	1
secure	1
a	1
lasting	1
convenience	1
of	1
that	1
kind.	1
But,	1
perhaps,	1
his	1
sister	1
does	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
the	1
present,	1
and,	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
under	1
his	1
sole	1
care,	1
he	1
may	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
likes	1
with	1
her."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam,	1
"that	1
is	1
an	1
advantage	1
which	1
he	1
must	1
divide	1
with	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
joined	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
guardianship	1
of	1
Miss	1
Darcy."	1
"Are	1
you	1
indeed?	1
And	1
pray	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
guardians	1
do	1
you	1
make?	1
Does	1
your	1
charge	1
give	1
you	1
much	1
trouble?	1
Young	1
ladies	1
of	1
her	1
age	1
are	1
sometimes	1
a	1
little	1
difficult	1
to	1
manage,	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
has	1
the	1
true	1
Darcy	1
spirit,	1
she	1
may	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
own	1
way."	1
As	1
she	1
spoke	1
she	1
observed	1
him	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
earnestly;	1
and	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
immediately	1
asked	1
her	1
why	1
she	1
supposed	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
likely	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
any	1
uneasiness,	1
convinced	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
somehow	1
or	1
other	1
got	1
pretty	1
near	1
the	1
truth.	1
She	1
directly	1
replied:	1
"You	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
frightened.	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
any	1
harm	1
of	1
her;	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
she	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
tractable	1
creatures	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
She	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
favourite	1
with	1
some	1
ladies	1
of	1
my	1
acquaintance,	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bingley.	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
you	1
know	1
them."	1
"I	1
know	1
them	1
a	1
little.	1
Their	1
brother	1
is	1
a	1
pleasant	1
gentlemanlike	1
man--he	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
Darcy's."	1
"Oh!	1
yes,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
drily;	1
"Mr.	1
Darcy	1
is	1
uncommonly	1
kind	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
and	1
takes	1
a	1
prodigious	1
deal	1
of	1
care	1
of	1
him."	1
"Care	1
of	1
him!	1
Yes,	1
I	1
really	1
believe	1
Darcy	1
_does_	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
those	1
points	1
where	1
he	1
most	1
wants	1
care.	1
From	1
something	1
that	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
in	1
our	1
journey	1
hither,	1
I	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
think	1
Bingley	1
very	1
much	1
indebted	1
to	1
him.	1
But	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
beg	1
his	1
pardon,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
Bingley	1
was	1
the	1
person	1
meant.	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
conjecture."	1
"What	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
mean?"	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
circumstance	1
which	1
Darcy	1
could	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
generally	1
known,	1
because	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
get	1
round	1
to	1
the	1
lady's	1
family,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
thing."	1
"You	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
my	1
not	1
mentioning	1
it."	1
"And	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
much	1
reason	1
for	1
supposing	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
Bingley.	1
What	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
was	1
merely	1
this:	1
that	1
he	1
congratulated	1
himself	1
on	1
having	1
lately	1
saved	1
a	1
friend	1
from	1
the	1
inconveniences	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
imprudent	1
marriage,	1
but	1
without	1
mentioning	1
names	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
particulars,	1
and	1
I	1
only	1
suspected	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
Bingley	1
from	1
believing	1
him	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
young	1
man	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
a	1
scrape	1
of	1
that	1
sort,	1
and	1
from	1
knowing	1
them	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
together	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
last	1
summer."	1
"Did	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
give	1
you	1
reasons	1
for	1
this	1
interference?"	1
"I	1
understood	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
very	1
strong	1
objections	1
against	1
the	1
lady."	1
"And	1
what	1
arts	1
did	1
he	1
use	1
to	1
separate	1
them?"	1
"He	1
did	1
not	1
talk	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
arts,"	1
said	1
Fitzwilliam,	1
smiling.	1
"He	1
only	1
told	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
told	1
you."	1
Elizabeth	1
made	1
no	1
answer,	1
and	1
walked	1
on,	1
her	1
heart	1
swelling	1
with	1
indignation.	1
After	1
watching	1
her	1
a	1
little,	1
Fitzwilliam	1
asked	1
her	1
why	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
thoughtful.	1
"I	1
am	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
telling	1
me,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"Your	1
cousin's	1
conduct	1
does	1
not	1
suit	1
my	1
feelings.	1
Why	1
was	1
he	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
judge?"	1
"You	1
are	1
rather	1
disposed	1
to	1
call	1
his	1
interference	1
officious?"	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
what	1
right	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
had	1
to	1
decide	1
on	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
his	1
friend's	1
inclination,	1
or	1
why,	1
upon	1
his	1
own	1
judgement	1
alone,	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
determine	1
and	1
direct	1
in	1
what	1
manner	1
his	1
friend	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
happy.	1
But,"	1
she	1
continued,	1
recollecting	1
herself,	1
"as	1
we	1
know	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
particulars,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
fair	1
to	1
condemn	1
him.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
affection	1
in	1
the	1
case."	1
"That	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
unnatural	1
surmise,"	1
said	1
Fitzwilliam,	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
lessening	1
of	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
my	1
cousin's	1
triumph	1
very	1
sadly."	1
This	1
was	1
spoken	1
jestingly;	1
but	1
it	1
appeared	1
to	1
her	1
so	1
just	1
a	1
picture	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
trust	1
herself	1
with	1
an	1
answer,	1
and	1
therefore,	1
abruptly	1
changing	1
the	1
conversation	1
talked	1
on	1
indifferent	1
matters	1
until	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
Parsonage.	1
There,	1
shut	1
into	1
her	1
own	1
room,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
their	1
visitor	1
left	1
them,	1
she	1
could	1
think	1
without	1
interruption	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
heard.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
any	1
other	1
people	1
could	1
be	1
meant	1
than	1
those	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
connected.	1
There	1
could	1
not	1
exist	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
_two_	1
men	1
over	1
whom	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
could	1
have	1
such	1
boundless	1
influence.	1
That	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
concerned	1
in	1
the	1
measures	1
taken	1
to	1
separate	1
Bingley	1
and	1
Jane	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
doubted;	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
always	1
attributed	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
the	1
principal	1
design	1
and	1
arrangement	1
of	1
them.	1
If	1
his	1
own	1
vanity,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
mislead	1
him,	1
_he_	1
was	1
the	1
cause,	1
his	1
pride	1
and	1
caprice	1
were	1
the	1
cause,	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
Jane	1
had	1
suffered,	1
and	1
still	1
continued	1
to	1
suffer.	1
He	1
had	1
ruined	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
every	1
hope	1
of	1
happiness	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
affectionate,	1
generous	1
heart	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
say	1
how	1
lasting	1
an	1
evil	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
inflicted.	1
"There	1
were	1
some	1
very	1
strong	1
objections	1
against	1
the	1
lady,"	1
were	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam's	1
words;	1
and	1
those	1
strong	1
objections	1
probably	1
were,	1
her	1
having	1
one	1
uncle	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
country	1
attorney,	1
and	1
another	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
business	1
in	1
London.	1
"To	1
Jane	1
herself,"	1
she	1
exclaimed,	1
"there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
possibility	1
of	1
objection;	1
all	1
loveliness	1
and	1
goodness	1
as	1
she	1
is!--her	1
understanding	1
excellent,	1
her	1
mind	1
improved,	1
and	1
her	1
manners	1
captivating.	1
Neither	1
could	1
anything	1
be	1
urged	1
against	1
my	1
father,	1
who,	1
though	1
with	1
some	1
peculiarities,	1
has	1
abilities	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
himself	1
need	1
not	1
disdain,	1
and	1
respectability	1
which	1
he	1
will	1
probably	1
never	1
reach."	1
When	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
her	1
mother,	1
her	1
confidence	1
gave	1
way	1
a	1
little;	1
but	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
that	1
any	1
objections	1
_there_	1
had	1
material	1
weight	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
whose	1
pride,	1
she	1
was	1
convinced,	1
would	1
receive	1
a	1
deeper	1
wound	1
from	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
importance	1
in	1
his	1
friend's	1
connections,	1
than	1
from	1
their	1
want	1
of	1
sense;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
decided,	1
at	1
last,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
partly	1
governed	1
by	1
this	1
worst	1
kind	1
of	1
pride,	1
and	1
partly	1
by	1
the	1
wish	1
of	1
retaining	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
for	1
his	1
sister.	1
The	1
agitation	1
and	1
tears	1
which	1
the	1
subject	1
occasioned,	1
brought	1
on	1
a	1
headache;	1
and	1
it	1
grew	1
so	1
much	1
worse	1
towards	1
the	1
evening,	1
that,	1
added	1
to	1
her	1
unwillingness	1
to	1
see	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
it	1
determined	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
attend	1
her	1
cousins	1
to	1
Rosings,	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
engaged	1
to	1
drink	1
tea.	1
Mrs.	1
Collins,	1
seeing	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
really	1
unwell,	1
did	1
not	1
press	1
her	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
prevented	1
her	1
husband	1
from	1
pressing	1
her;	1
but	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
could	1
not	1
conceal	1
his	1
apprehension	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine's	1
being	1
rather	1
displeased	1
by	1
her	1
staying	1
at	1
home.	1
Chapter	1
34	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
gone,	1
Elizabeth,	1
as	1
if	1
intending	1
to	1
exasperate	1
herself	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
against	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
chose	1
for	1
her	1
employment	1
the	1
examination	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
letters	1
which	1
Jane	1
had	1
written	1
to	1
her	1
since	1
her	1
being	1
in	1
Kent.	1
They	1
contained	1
no	1
actual	1
complaint,	1
nor	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
revival	1
of	1
past	1
occurrences,	1
or	1
any	1
communication	1
of	1
present	1
suffering.	1
But	1
in	1
all,	1
and	1
in	1
almost	1
every	1
line	1
of	1
each,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
that	1
cheerfulness	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
characterise	1
her	1
style,	1
and	1
which,	1
proceeding	1
from	1
the	1
serenity	1
of	1
a	1
mind	1
at	1
ease	1
with	1
itself	1
and	1
kindly	1
disposed	1
towards	1
everyone,	1
had	1
been	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
clouded.	1
Elizabeth	1
noticed	1
every	1
sentence	1
conveying	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
uneasiness,	1
with	1
an	1
attention	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
hardly	1
received	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
perusal.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
shameful	1
boast	1
of	1
what	1
misery	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
inflict,	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
keener	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
sister's	1
sufferings.	1
It	1
was	1
some	1
consolation	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
his	1
visit	1
to	1
Rosings	1
was	1
to	1
end	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
the	1
next--and,	1
a	1
still	1
greater,	1
that	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
fortnight	1
she	1
should	1
herself	1
be	1
with	1
Jane	1
again,	1
and	1
enabled	1
to	1
contribute	1
to	1
the	1
recovery	1
of	1
her	1
spirits,	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
affection	1
could	1
do.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
Darcy's	1
leaving	1
Kent	1
without	1
remembering	1
that	1
his	1
cousin	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
him;	1
but	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
had	1
made	1
it	1
clear	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
intentions	1
at	1
all,	1
and	1
agreeable	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
be	1
unhappy	1
about	1
him.	1
While	1
settling	1
this	1
point,	1
she	1
was	1
suddenly	1
roused	1
by	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
door-bell,	1
and	1
her	1
spirits	1
were	1
a	1
little	1
fluttered	1
by	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
himself,	1
who	1
had	1
once	1
before	1
called	1
late	1
in	1
the	1
evening,	1
and	1
might	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
inquire	1
particularly	1
after	1
her.	1
But	1
this	1
idea	1
was	1
soon	1
banished,	1
and	1
her	1
spirits	1
were	1
very	1
differently	1
affected,	1
when,	1
to	1
her	1
utter	1
amazement,	1
she	1
saw	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
walk	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
In	1
an	1
hurried	1
manner	1
he	1
immediately	1
began	1
an	1
inquiry	1
after	1
her	1
health,	1
imputing	1
his	1
visit	1
to	1
a	1
wish	1
of	1
hearing	1
that	1
she	1
were	1
better.	1
She	1
answered	1
him	1
with	1
cold	1
civility.	1
He	1
sat	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments,	1
and	1
then	1
getting	1
up,	1
walked	1
about	1
the	1
room.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
surprised,	1
but	1
said	1
not	1
a	1
word.	1
After	1
a	1
silence	1
of	1
several	1
minutes,	1
he	1
came	1
towards	1
her	1
in	1
an	1
agitated	1
manner,	1
and	1
thus	1
began:	1
"In	1
vain	1
I	1
have	1
struggled.	1
It	1
will	1
not	1
do.	1
My	1
feelings	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
repressed.	1
You	1
must	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
ardently	1
I	1
admire	1
and	1
love	1
you."	1
Elizabeth's	1
astonishment	1
was	1
beyond	1
expression.	1
She	1
stared,	1
coloured,	1
doubted,	1
and	1
was	1
silent.	1
This	1
he	1
considered	1
sufficient	1
encouragement;	1
and	1
the	1
avowal	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
felt,	1
and	1
had	1
long	1
felt	1
for	1
her,	1
immediately	1
followed.	1
He	1
spoke	1
well;	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
feelings	1
besides	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
to	1
be	1
detailed;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
more	1
eloquent	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
tenderness	1
than	1
of	1
pride.	1
His	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
inferiority--of	1
its	1
being	1
a	1
degradation--of	1
the	1
family	1
obstacles	1
which	1
had	1
always	1
opposed	1
to	1
inclination,	1
were	1
dwelt	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
warmth	1
which	1
seemed	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
consequence	1
he	1
was	1
wounding,	1
but	1
was	1
very	1
unlikely	1
to	1
recommend	1
his	1
suit.	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
deeply-rooted	1
dislike,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
insensible	1
to	1
the	1
compliment	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
man's	1
affection,	1
and	1
though	1
her	1
intentions	1
did	1
not	1
vary	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
sorry	1
for	1
the	1
pain	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
receive;	1
till,	1
roused	1
to	1
resentment	1
by	1
his	1
subsequent	1
language,	1
she	1
lost	1
all	1
compassion	1
in	1
anger.	1
She	1
tried,	1
however,	1
to	1
compose	1
herself	1
to	1
answer	1
him	1
with	1
patience,	1
when	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
done.	1
He	1
concluded	1
with	1
representing	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
that	1
attachment	1
which,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
endeavours,	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
impossible	1
to	1
conquer;	1
and	1
with	1
expressing	1
his	1
hope	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
now	1
be	1
rewarded	1
by	1
her	1
acceptance	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
this,	1
she	1
could	1
easily	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
a	1
favourable	1
answer.	1
He	1
_spoke_	1
of	1
apprehension	1
and	1
anxiety,	1
but	1
his	1
countenance	1
expressed	1
real	1
security.	1
Such	1
a	1
circumstance	1
could	1
only	1
exasperate	1
farther,	1
and,	1
when	1
he	1
ceased,	1
the	1
colour	1
rose	1
into	1
her	1
cheeks,	1
and	1
she	1
said:	1
"In	1
such	1
cases	1
as	1
this,	1
it	1
is,	1
I	1
believe,	1
the	1
established	1
mode	1
to	1
express	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
obligation	1
for	1
the	1
sentiments	1
avowed,	1
however	1
unequally	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
returned.	1
It	1
is	1
natural	1
that	1
obligation	1
should	1
be	1
felt,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
_feel_	1
gratitude,	1
I	1
would	1
now	1
thank	1
you.	1
But	1
I	1
cannot--I	1
have	1
never	1
desired	1
your	1
good	1
opinion,	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
certainly	1
bestowed	1
it	1
most	1
unwillingly.	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
to	1
have	1
occasioned	1
pain	1
to	1
anyone.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
most	1
unconsciously	1
done,	1
however,	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
short	1
duration.	1
The	1
feelings	1
which,	1
you	1
tell	1
me,	1
have	1
long	1
prevented	1
the	1
acknowledgment	1
of	1
your	1
regard,	1
can	1
have	1
little	1
difficulty	1
in	1
overcoming	1
it	1
after	1
this	1
explanation."	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
who	1
was	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
mantelpiece	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
her	1
face,	1
seemed	1
to	1
catch	1
her	1
words	1
with	1
no	1
less	1
resentment	1
than	1
surprise.	1
His	1
complexion	1
became	1
pale	1
with	1
anger,	1
and	1
the	1
disturbance	1
of	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
visible	1
in	1
every	1
feature.	1
He	1
was	1
struggling	1
for	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
composure,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
open	1
his	1
lips	1
till	1
he	1
believed	1
himself	1
to	1
have	1
attained	1
it.	1
The	1
pause	1
was	1
to	1
Elizabeth's	1
feelings	1
dreadful.	1
At	1
length,	1
with	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
forced	1
calmness,	1
he	1
said:	1
"And	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
reply	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
expecting!	1
I	1
might,	1
perhaps,	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
informed	1
why,	1
with	1
so	1
little	1
_endeavour_	1
at	1
civility,	1
I	1
am	1
thus	1
rejected.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
small	1
importance."	1
"I	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
inquire,"	1
replied	1
she,	1
"why	1
with	1
so	1
evident	1
a	1
desire	1
of	1
offending	1
and	1
insulting	1
me,	1
you	1
chose	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
liked	1
me	1
against	1
your	1
will,	1
against	1
your	1
reason,	1
and	1
even	1
against	1
your	1
character?	1
Was	1
not	1
this	1
some	1
excuse	1
for	1
incivility,	1
if	1
I	1
_was_	1
uncivil?	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
other	1
provocations.	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
have.	1
Had	1
not	1
my	1
feelings	1
decided	1
against	1
you--had	1
they	1
been	1
indifferent,	1
or	1
had	1
they	1
even	1
been	1
favourable,	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
any	1
consideration	1
would	1
tempt	1
me	1
to	1
accept	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
ruining,	1
perhaps	1
for	1
ever,	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
beloved	1
sister?"	1
As	1
she	1
pronounced	1
these	1
words,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
changed	1
colour;	1
but	1
the	1
emotion	1
was	1
short,	1
and	1
he	1
listened	1
without	1
attempting	1
to	1
interrupt	1
her	1
while	1
she	1
continued:	1
"I	1
have	1
every	1
reason	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
think	1
ill	1
of	1
you.	1
No	1
motive	1
can	1
excuse	1
the	1
unjust	1
and	1
ungenerous	1
part	1
you	1
acted	1
_there_.	1
You	1
dare	1
not,	1
you	1
cannot	1
deny,	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
principal,	1
if	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
means	1
of	1
dividing	1
them	1
from	1
each	1
other--of	1
exposing	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
censure	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
caprice	1
and	1
instability,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
its	1
derision	1
for	1
disappointed	1
hopes,	1
and	1
involving	1
them	1
both	1
in	1
misery	1
of	1
the	1
acutest	1
kind."	1
She	1
paused,	1
and	1
saw	1
with	1
no	1
slight	1
indignation	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
listening	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
which	1
proved	1
him	1
wholly	1
unmoved	1
by	1
any	1
feeling	1
of	1
remorse.	1
He	1
even	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
affected	1
incredulity.	1
"Can	1
you	1
deny	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
it?"	1
she	1
repeated.	1
With	1
assumed	1
tranquillity	1
he	1
then	1
replied:	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
wish	1
of	1
denying	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
everything	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
separate	1
my	1
friend	1
from	1
your	1
sister,	1
or	1
that	1
I	1
rejoice	1
in	1
my	1
success.	1
Towards	1
_him_	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
kinder	1
than	1
towards	1
myself."	1
Elizabeth	1
disdained	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
noticing	1
this	1
civil	1
reflection,	1
but	1
its	1
meaning	1
did	1
not	1
escape,	1
nor	1
was	1
it	1
likely	1
to	1
conciliate	1
her.	1
"But	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
merely	1
this	1
affair,"	1
she	1
continued,	1
"on	1
which	1
my	1
dislike	1
is	1
founded.	1
Long	1
before	1
it	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
my	1
opinion	1
of	1
you	1
was	1
decided.	1
Your	1
character	1
was	1
unfolded	1
in	1
the	1
recital	1
which	1
I	1
received	1
many	1
months	1
ago	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Wickham.	1
On	1
this	1
subject,	1
what	1
can	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
say?	1
In	1
what	1
imaginary	1
act	1
of	1
friendship	1
can	1
you	1
here	1
defend	1
yourself?	1
or	1
under	1
what	1
misrepresentation	1
can	1
you	1
here	1
impose	1
upon	1
others?"	1
"You	1
take	1
an	1
eager	1
interest	1
in	1
that	1
gentleman's	1
concerns,"	1
said	1
Darcy,	1
in	1
a	1
less	1
tranquil	1
tone,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
heightened	1
colour.	1
"Who	1
that	1
knows	1
what	1
his	1
misfortunes	1
have	1
been,	1
can	1
help	1
feeling	1
an	1
interest	1
in	1
him?"	1
"His	1
misfortunes!"	1
repeated	1
Darcy	1
contemptuously;	1
"yes,	1
his	1
misfortunes	1
have	1
been	1
great	1
indeed."	1
"And	1
of	1
your	1
infliction,"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth	1
with	1
energy.	1
"You	1
have	1
reduced	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
present	1
state	1
of	1
poverty--comparative	1
poverty.	1
You	1
have	1
withheld	1
the	1
advantages	1
which	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
designed	1
for	1
him.	1
You	1
have	1
deprived	1
the	1
best	1
years	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
of	1
that	1
independence	1
which	1
was	1
no	1
less	1
his	1
due	1
than	1
his	1
desert.	1
You	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
this!	1
and	1
yet	1
you	1
can	1
treat	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
his	1
misfortune	1
with	1
contempt	1
and	1
ridicule."	1
"And	1
this,"	1
cried	1
Darcy,	1
as	1
he	1
walked	1
with	1
quick	1
steps	1
across	1
the	1
room,	1
"is	1
your	1
opinion	1
of	1
me!	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
estimation	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
hold	1
me!	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
explaining	1
it	1
so	1
fully.	1
My	1
faults,	1
according	1
to	1
this	1
calculation,	1
are	1
heavy	1
indeed!	1
But	1
perhaps,"	1
added	1
he,	1
stopping	1
in	1
his	1
walk,	1
and	1
turning	1
towards	1
her,	1
"these	1
offenses	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
overlooked,	1
had	1
not	1
your	1
pride	1
been	1
hurt	1
by	1
my	1
honest	1
confession	1
of	1
the	1
scruples	1
that	1
had	1
long	1
prevented	1
my	1
forming	1
any	1
serious	1
design.	1
These	1
bitter	1
accusations	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
suppressed,	1
had	1
I,	1
with	1
greater	1
policy,	1
concealed	1
my	1
struggles,	1
and	1
flattered	1
you	1
into	1
the	1
belief	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
impelled	1
by	1
unqualified,	1
unalloyed	1
inclination;	1
by	1
reason,	1
by	1
reflection,	1
by	1
everything.	1
But	1
disguise	1
of	1
every	1
sort	1
is	1
my	1
abhorrence.	1
Nor	1
am	1
I	1
ashamed	1
of	1
the	1
feelings	1
I	1
related.	1
They	1
were	1
natural	1
and	1
just.	1
Could	1
you	1
expect	1
me	1
to	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
inferiority	1
of	1
your	1
connections?--to	1
congratulate	1
myself	1
on	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
relations,	1
whose	1
condition	1
in	1
life	1
is	1
so	1
decidedly	1
beneath	1
my	1
own?"	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
herself	1
growing	1
more	1
angry	1
every	1
moment;	1
yet	1
she	1
tried	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
composure	1
when	1
she	1
said:	1
"You	1
are	1
mistaken,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
if	1
you	1
suppose	1
that	1
the	1
mode	1
of	1
your	1
declaration	1
affected	1
me	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
way,	1
than	1
as	1
it	1
spared	1
me	1
the	1
concern	1
which	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
felt	1
in	1
refusing	1
you,	1
had	1
you	1
behaved	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
gentlemanlike	1
manner."	1
She	1
saw	1
him	1
start	1
at	1
this,	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
nothing,	1
and	1
she	1
continued:	1
"You	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
offer	1
of	1
your	1
hand	1
in	1
any	1
possible	1
way	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
tempted	1
me	1
to	1
accept	1
it."	1
Again	1
his	1
astonishment	1
was	1
obvious;	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
mingled	1
incredulity	1
and	1
mortification.	1
She	1
went	1
on:	1
"From	1
the	1
very	1
beginning--from	1
the	1
first	1
moment,	1
I	1
may	1
almost	1
say--of	1
my	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
you,	1
your	1
manners,	1
impressing	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
fullest	1
belief	1
of	1
your	1
arrogance,	1
your	1
conceit,	1
and	1
your	1
selfish	1
disdain	1
of	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
others,	1
were	1
such	1
as	1
to	1
form	1
the	1
groundwork	1
of	1
disapprobation	1
on	1
which	1
succeeding	1
events	1
have	1
built	1
so	1
immovable	1
a	1
dislike;	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
you	1
a	1
month	1
before	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
the	1
last	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
whom	1
I	1
could	1
ever	1
be	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
marry."	1
"You	1
have	1
said	1
quite	1
enough,	1
madam.	1
I	1
perfectly	1
comprehend	1
your	1
feelings,	1
and	1
have	1
now	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
what	1
my	1
own	1
have	1
been.	1
Forgive	1
me	1
for	1
having	1
taken	1
up	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
your	1
time,	1
and	1
accept	1
my	1
best	1
wishes	1
for	1
your	1
health	1
and	1
happiness."	1
And	1
with	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
hastily	1
left	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
heard	1
him	1
the	1
next	1
moment	1
open	1
the	1
front	1
door	1
and	1
quit	1
the	1
house.	1
The	1
tumult	1
of	1
her	1
mind,	1
was	1
now	1
painfully	1
great.	1
She	1
knew	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
support	1
herself,	1
and	1
from	1
actual	1
weakness	1
sat	1
down	1
and	1
cried	1
for	1
half-an-hour.	1
Her	1
astonishment,	1
as	1
she	1
reflected	1
on	1
what	1
had	1
passed,	1
was	1
increased	1
by	1
every	1
review	1
of	1
it.	1
That	1
she	1
should	1
receive	1
an	1
offer	1
of	1
marriage	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Darcy!	1
That	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
months!	1
So	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
as	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
marry	1
her	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
objections	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
prevent	1
his	1
friend's	1
marrying	1
her	1
sister,	1
and	1
which	1
must	1
appear	1
at	1
least	1
with	1
equal	1
force	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
case--was	1
almost	1
incredible!	1
It	1
was	1
gratifying	1
to	1
have	1
inspired	1
unconsciously	1
so	1
strong	1
an	1
affection.	1
But	1
his	1
pride,	1
his	1
abominable	1
pride--his	1
shameless	1
avowal	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
Jane--his	1
unpardonable	1
assurance	1
in	1
acknowledging,	1
though	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
justify	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
unfeeling	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
mentioned	1
Mr.	1
Wickham,	1
his	1
cruelty	1
towards	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
attempted	1
to	1
deny,	1
soon	1
overcame	1
the	1
pity	1
which	1
the	1
consideration	1
of	1
his	1
attachment	1
had	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
excited.	1
She	1
continued	1
in	1
very	1
agitated	1
reflections	1
till	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
Lady	1
Catherine's	1
carriage	1
made	1
her	1
feel	1
how	1
unequal	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
encounter	1
Charlotte's	1
observation,	1
and	1
hurried	1
her	1
away	1
to	1
her	1
room.	1
Chapter	1
35	1
Elizabeth	1
awoke	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
thoughts	1
and	1
meditations	1
which	1
had	1
at	1
length	1
closed	1
her	1
eyes.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
yet	1
recover	1
from	1
the	1
surprise	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
happened;	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
anything	1
else;	1
and,	1
totally	1
indisposed	1
for	1
employment,	1
she	1
resolved,	1
soon	1
after	1
breakfast,	1
to	1
indulge	1
herself	1
in	1
air	1
and	1
exercise.	1
She	1
was	1
proceeding	1
directly	1
to	1
her	1
favourite	1
walk,	1
when	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
sometimes	1
coming	1
there	1
stopped	1
her,	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
entering	1
the	1
park,	1
she	1
turned	1
up	1
the	1
lane,	1
which	1
led	1
farther	1
from	1
the	1
turnpike-road.	1
The	1
park	1
paling	1
was	1
still	1
the	1
boundary	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
she	1
soon	1
passed	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
gates	1
into	1
the	1
ground.	1
After	1
walking	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
along	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
lane,	1
she	1
was	1
tempted,	1
by	1
the	1
pleasantness	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
to	1
stop	1
at	1
the	1
gates	1
and	1
look	1
into	1
the	1
park.	1
The	1
five	1
weeks	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
now	1
passed	1
in	1
Kent	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
difference	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
every	1
day	1
was	1
adding	1
to	1
the	1
verdure	1
of	1
the	1
early	1
trees.	1
She	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
continuing	1
her	1
walk,	1
when	1
she	1
caught	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman	1
within	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
grove	1
which	1
edged	1
the	1
park;	1
he	1
was	1
moving	1
that	1
way;	1
and,	1
fearful	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
she	1
was	1
directly	1
retreating.	1
But	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
advanced	1
was	1
now	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
her,	1
and	1
stepping	1
forward	1
with	1
eagerness,	1
pronounced	1
her	1
name.	1
She	1
had	1
turned	1
away;	1
but	1
on	1
hearing	1
herself	1
called,	1
though	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
which	1
proved	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
she	1
moved	1
again	1
towards	1
the	1
gate.	1
He	1
had	1
by	1
that	1
time	1
reached	1
it	1
also,	1
and,	1
holding	1
out	1
a	1
letter,	1
which	1
she	1
instinctively	1
took,	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
of	1
haughty	1
composure,	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
grove	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
meeting	1
you.	1
Will	1
you	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
reading	1
that	1
letter?"	1
And	1
then,	1
with	1
a	1
slight	1
bow,	1
turned	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
plantation,	1
and	1
was	1
soon	1
out	1
of	1
sight.	1
With	1
no	1
expectation	1
of	1
pleasure,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
strongest	1
curiosity,	1
Elizabeth	1
opened	1
the	1
letter,	1
and,	1
to	1
her	1
still	1
increasing	1
wonder,	1
perceived	1
an	1
envelope	1
containing	1
two	1
sheets	1
of	1
letter-paper,	1
written	1
quite	1
through,	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
close	1
hand.	1
The	1
envelope	1
itself	1
was	1
likewise	1
full.	1
Pursuing	1
her	1
way	1
along	1
the	1
lane,	1
she	1
then	1
began	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
dated	1
from	1
Rosings,	1
at	1
eight	1
o'clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
was	1
as	1
follows:--	1
"Be	1
not	1
alarmed,	1
madam,	1
on	1
receiving	1
this	1
letter,	1
by	1
the	1
apprehension	1
of	1
its	1
containing	1
any	1
repetition	1
of	1
those	1
sentiments	1
or	1
renewal	1
of	1
those	1
offers	1
which	1
were	1
last	1
night	1
so	1
disgusting	1
to	1
you.	1
I	1
write	1
without	1
any	1
intention	1
of	1
paining	1
you,	1
or	1
humbling	1
myself,	1
by	1
dwelling	1
on	1
wishes	1
which,	1
for	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
both,	1
cannot	1
be	1
too	1
soon	1
forgotten;	1
and	1
the	1
effort	1
which	1
the	1
formation	1
and	1
the	1
perusal	1
of	1
this	1
letter	1
must	1
occasion,	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
spared,	1
had	1
not	1
my	1
character	1
required	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
written	1
and	1
read.	1
You	1
must,	1
therefore,	1
pardon	1
the	1
freedom	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
demand	1
your	1
attention;	1
your	1
feelings,	1
I	1
know,	1
will	1
bestow	1
it	1
unwillingly,	1
but	1
I	1
demand	1
it	1
of	1
your	1
justice.	1
"Two	1
offenses	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
nature,	1
and	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
of	1
equal	1
magnitude,	1
you	1
last	1
night	1
laid	1
to	1
my	1
charge.	1
The	1
first	1
mentioned	1
was,	1
that,	1
regardless	1
of	1
the	1
sentiments	1
of	1
either,	1
I	1
had	1
detached	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
from	1
your	1
sister,	1
and	1
the	1
other,	1
that	1
I	1
had,	1
in	1
defiance	1
of	1
various	1
claims,	1
in	1
defiance	1
of	1
honour	1
and	1
humanity,	1
ruined	1
the	1
immediate	1
prosperity	1
and	1
blasted	1
the	1
prospects	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Wickham.	1
Wilfully	1
and	1
wantonly	1
to	1
have	1
thrown	1
off	1
the	1
companion	1
of	1
my	1
youth,	1
the	1
acknowledged	1
favourite	1
of	1
my	1
father,	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
scarcely	1
any	1
other	1
dependence	1
than	1
on	1
our	1
patronage,	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
to	1
expect	1
its	1
exertion,	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
depravity,	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
separation	1
of	1
two	1
young	1
persons,	1
whose	1
affection	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
growth	1
of	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
weeks,	1
could	1
bear	1
no	1
comparison.	1
But	1
from	1
the	1
severity	1
of	1
that	1
blame	1
which	1
was	1
last	1
night	1
so	1
liberally	1
bestowed,	1
respecting	1
each	1
circumstance,	1
I	1
shall	1
hope	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
future	1
secured,	1
when	1
the	1
following	1
account	1
of	1
my	1
actions	1
and	1
their	1
motives	1
has	1
been	1
read.	1
If,	1
in	1
the	1
explanation	1
of	1
them,	1
which	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
myself,	1
I	1
am	1
under	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
relating	1
feelings	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
offensive	1
to	1
yours,	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
sorry.	1
The	1
necessity	1
must	1
be	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
further	1
apology	1
would	1
be	1
absurd.	1
"I	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
long	1
in	1
Hertfordshire,	1
before	1
I	1
saw,	1
in	1
common	1
with	1
others,	1
that	1
Bingley	1
preferred	1
your	1
elder	1
sister	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
young	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
till	1
the	1
evening	1
of	1
the	1
dance	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
any	1
apprehension	1
of	1
his	1
feeling	1
a	1
serious	1
attachment.	1
I	1
had	1
often	1
seen	1
him	1
in	1
love	1
before.	1
At	1
that	1
ball,	1
while	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
dancing	1
with	1
you,	1
I	1
was	1
first	1
made	1
acquainted,	1
by	1
Sir	1
William	1
Lucas's	1
accidental	1
information,	1
that	1
Bingley's	1
attentions	1
to	1
your	1
sister	1
had	1
given	1
rise	1
to	1
a	1
general	1
expectation	1
of	1
their	1
marriage.	1
He	1
spoke	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
certain	1
event,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
time	1
alone	1
could	1
be	1
undecided.	1
From	1
that	1
moment	1
I	1
observed	1
my	1
friend's	1
behaviour	1
attentively;	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
then	1
perceive	1
that	1
his	1
partiality	1
for	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
was	1
beyond	1
what	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
witnessed	1
in	1
him.	1
Your	1
sister	1
I	1
also	1
watched.	1
Her	1
look	1
and	1
manners	1
were	1
open,	1
cheerful,	1
and	1
engaging	1
as	1
ever,	1
but	1
without	1
any	1
symptom	1
of	1
peculiar	1
regard,	1
and	1
I	1
remained	1
convinced	1
from	1
the	1
evening's	1
scrutiny,	1
that	1
though	1
she	1
received	1
his	1
attentions	1
with	1
pleasure,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
invite	1
them	1
by	1
any	1
participation	1
of	1
sentiment.	1
If	1
_you_	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
mistaken	1
here,	1
_I_	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
error.	1
Your	1
superior	1
knowledge	1
of	1
your	1
sister	1
must	1
make	1
the	1
latter	1
probable.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
so,	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
misled	1
by	1
such	1
error	1
to	1
inflict	1
pain	1
on	1
her,	1
your	1
resentment	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
unreasonable.	1
But	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
scruple	1
to	1
assert,	1
that	1
the	1
serenity	1
of	1
your	1
sister's	1
countenance	1
and	1
air	1
was	1
such	1
as	1
might	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
most	1
acute	1
observer	1
a	1
conviction	1
that,	1
however	1
amiable	1
her	1
temper,	1
her	1
heart	1
was	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
easily	1
touched.	1
That	1
I	1
was	1
desirous	1
of	1
believing	1
her	1
indifferent	1
is	1
certain--but	1
I	1
will	1
venture	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
my	1
investigation	1
and	1
decisions	1
are	1
not	1
usually	1
influenced	1
by	1
my	1
hopes	1
or	1
fears.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
believe	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
indifferent	1
because	1
I	1
wished	1
it;	1
I	1
believed	1
it	1
on	1
impartial	1
conviction,	1
as	1
truly	1
as	1
I	1
wished	1
it	1
in	1
reason.	1
My	1
objections	1
to	1
the	1
marriage	1
were	1
not	1
merely	1
those	1
which	1
I	1
last	1
night	1
acknowledged	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
utmost	1
force	1
of	1
passion	1
to	1
put	1
aside,	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
case;	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
connection	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
great	1
an	1
evil	1
to	1
my	1
friend	1
as	1
to	1
me.	1
But	1
there	1
were	1
other	1
causes	1
of	1
repugnance;	1
causes	1
which,	1
though	1
still	1
existing,	1
and	1
existing	1
to	1
an	1
equal	1
degree	1
in	1
both	1
instances,	1
I	1
had	1
myself	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
forget,	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
immediately	1
before	1
me.	1
These	1
causes	1
must	1
be	1
stated,	1
though	1
briefly.	1
The	1
situation	1
of	1
your	1
mother's	1
family,	1
though	1
objectionable,	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
comparison	1
to	1
that	1
total	1
want	1
of	1
propriety	1
so	1
frequently,	1
so	1
almost	1
uniformly	1
betrayed	1
by	1
herself,	1
by	1
your	1
three	1
younger	1
sisters,	1
and	1
occasionally	1
even	1
by	1
your	1
father.	1
Pardon	1
me.	1
It	1
pains	1
me	1
to	1
offend	1
you.	1
But	1
amidst	1
your	1
concern	1
for	1
the	1
defects	1
of	1
your	1
nearest	1
relations,	1
and	1
your	1
displeasure	1
at	1
this	1
representation	1
of	1
them,	1
let	1
it	1
give	1
you	1
consolation	1
to	1
consider	1
that,	1
to	1
have	1
conducted	1
yourselves	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
avoid	1
any	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
like	1
censure,	1
is	1
praise	1
no	1
less	1
generally	1
bestowed	1
on	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
elder	1
sister,	1
than	1
it	1
is	1
honourable	1
to	1
the	1
sense	1
and	1
disposition	1
of	1
both.	1
I	1
will	1
only	1
say	1
farther	1
that	1
from	1
what	1
passed	1
that	1
evening,	1
my	1
opinion	1
of	1
all	1
parties	1
was	1
confirmed,	1
and	1
every	1
inducement	1
heightened	1
which	1
could	1
have	1
led	1
me	1
before,	1
to	1
preserve	1
my	1
friend	1
from	1
what	1
I	1
esteemed	1
a	1
most	1
unhappy	1
connection.	1
He	1
left	1
Netherfield	1
for	1
London,	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
following,	1
as	1
you,	1
I	1
am	1
certain,	1
remember,	1
with	1
the	1
design	1
of	1
soon	1
returning.	1
"The	1
part	1
which	1
I	1
acted	1
is	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
explained.	1
His	1
sisters'	1
uneasiness	1
had	1
been	1
equally	1
excited	1
with	1
my	1
own;	1
our	1
coincidence	1
of	1
feeling	1
was	1
soon	1
discovered,	1
and,	1
alike	1
sensible	1
that	1
no	1
time	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
lost	1
in	1
detaching	1
their	1
brother,	1
we	1
shortly	1
resolved	1
on	1
joining	1
him	1
directly	1
in	1
London.	1
We	1
accordingly	1
went--and	1
there	1
I	1
readily	1
engaged	1
in	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
pointing	1
out	1
to	1
my	1
friend	1
the	1
certain	1
evils	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
choice.	1
I	1
described,	1
and	1
enforced	1
them	1
earnestly.	1
But,	1
however	1
this	1
remonstrance	1
might	1
have	1
staggered	1
or	1
delayed	1
his	1
determination,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
suppose	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
ultimately	1
have	1
prevented	1
the	1
marriage,	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
seconded	1
by	1
the	1
assurance	1
that	1
I	1
hesitated	1
not	1
in	1
giving,	1
of	1
your	1
sister's	1
indifference.	1
He	1
had	1
before	1
believed	1
her	1
to	1
return	1
his	1
affection	1
with	1
sincere,	1
if	1
not	1
with	1
equal	1
regard.	1
But	1
Bingley	1
has	1
great	1
natural	1
modesty,	1
with	1
a	1
stronger	1
dependence	1
on	1
my	1
judgement	1
than	1
on	1
his	1
own.	1
To	1
convince	1
him,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
deceived	1
himself,	1
was	1
no	1
very	1
difficult	1
point.	1
To	1
persuade	1
him	1
against	1
returning	1
into	1
Hertfordshire,	1
when	1
that	1
conviction	1
had	1
been	1
given,	1
was	1
scarcely	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
a	1
moment.	1
I	1
cannot	1
blame	1
myself	1
for	1
having	1
done	1
thus	1
much.	1
There	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
conduct	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
reflect	1
with	1
satisfaction;	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
condescended	1
to	1
adopt	1
the	1
measures	1
of	1
art	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
conceal	1
from	1
him	1
your	1
sister's	1
being	1
in	1
town.	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
myself,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bingley;	1
but	1
her	1
brother	1
is	1
even	1
yet	1
ignorant	1
of	1
it.	1
That	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
met	1
without	1
ill	1
consequence	1
is	1
perhaps	1
probable;	1
but	1
his	1
regard	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
me	1
enough	1
extinguished	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
without	1
some	1
danger.	1
Perhaps	1
this	1
concealment,	1
this	1
disguise	1
was	1
beneath	1
me;	1
it	1
is	1
done,	1
however,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
done	1
for	1
the	1
best.	1
On	1
this	1
subject	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
say,	1
no	1
other	1
apology	1
to	1
offer.	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
wounded	1
your	1
sister's	1
feelings,	1
it	1
was	1
unknowingly	1
done	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
motives	1
which	1
governed	1
me	1
may	1
to	1
you	1
very	1
naturally	1
appear	1
insufficient,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
learnt	1
to	1
condemn	1
them.	1
"With	1
respect	1
to	1
that	1
other,	1
more	1
weighty	1
accusation,	1
of	1
having	1
injured	1
Mr.	1
Wickham,	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
refute	1
it	1
by	1
laying	1
before	1
you	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
his	1
connection	1
with	1
my	1
family.	1
Of	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
_particularly_	1
accused	1
me	1
I	1
am	1
ignorant;	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
relate,	1
I	1
can	1
summon	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
witness	1
of	1
undoubted	1
veracity.	1
"Mr.	1
Wickham	1
is	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
respectable	1
man,	1
who	1
had	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
Pemberley	1
estates,	1
and	1
whose	1
good	1
conduct	1
in	1
the	1
discharge	1
of	1
his	1
trust	1
naturally	1
inclined	1
my	1
father	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
service	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
on	1
George	1
Wickham,	1
who	1
was	1
his	1
godson,	1
his	1
kindness	1
was	1
therefore	1
liberally	1
bestowed.	1
My	1
father	1
supported	1
him	1
at	1
school,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
at	1
Cambridge--most	1
important	1
assistance,	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
father,	1
always	1
poor	1
from	1
the	1
extravagance	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
gentleman's	1
education.	1
My	1
father	1
was	1
not	1
only	1
fond	1
of	1
this	1
young	1
man's	1
society,	1
whose	1
manners	1
were	1
always	1
engaging;	1
he	1
had	1
also	1
the	1
highest	1
opinion	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
hoping	1
the	1
church	1
would	1
be	1
his	1
profession,	1
intended	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
it.	1
As	1
for	1
myself,	1
it	1
is	1
many,	1
many	1
years	1
since	1
I	1
first	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
manner.	1
The	1
vicious	1
propensities--the	1
want	1
of	1
principle,	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
careful	1
to	1
guard	1
from	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
his	1
best	1
friend,	1
could	1
not	1
escape	1
the	1
observation	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
nearly	1
the	1
same	1
age	1
with	1
himself,	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
opportunities	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
in	1
unguarded	1
moments,	1
which	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
could	1
not	1
have.	1
Here	1
again	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
pain--to	1
what	1
degree	1
you	1
only	1
can	1
tell.	1
But	1
whatever	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
sentiments	1
which	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
has	1
created,	1
a	1
suspicion	1
of	1
their	1
nature	1
shall	1
not	1
prevent	1
me	1
from	1
unfolding	1
his	1
real	1
character--it	1
adds	1
even	1
another	1
motive.	1
"My	1
excellent	1
father	1
died	1
about	1
five	1
years	1
ago;	1
and	1
his	1
attachment	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
was	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
so	1
steady,	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
will	1
he	1
particularly	1
recommended	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
to	1
promote	1
his	1
advancement	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
manner	1
that	1
his	1
profession	1
might	1
allow--and	1
if	1
he	1
took	1
orders,	1
desired	1
that	1
a	1
valuable	1
family	1
living	1
might	1
be	1
his	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
became	1
vacant.	1
There	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
legacy	1
of	1
one	1
thousand	1
pounds.	1
His	1
own	1
father	1
did	1
not	1
long	1
survive	1
mine,	1
and	1
within	1
half	1
a	1
year	1
from	1
these	1
events,	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
wrote	1
to	1
inform	1
me	1
that,	1
having	1
finally	1
resolved	1
against	1
taking	1
orders,	1
he	1
hoped	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
unreasonable	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
expect	1
some	1
more	1
immediate	1
pecuniary	1
advantage,	1
in	1
lieu	1
of	1
the	1
preferment,	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
benefited.	1
He	1
had	1
some	1
intention,	1
he	1
added,	1
of	1
studying	1
law,	1
and	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
aware	1
that	1
the	1
interest	1
of	1
one	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
insufficient	1
support	1
therein.	1
I	1
rather	1
wished,	1
than	1
believed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
sincere;	1
but,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
was	1
perfectly	1
ready	1
to	1
accede	1
to	1
his	1
proposal.	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
clergyman;	1
the	1
business	1
was	1
therefore	1
soon	1
settled--he	1
resigned	1
all	1
claim	1
to	1
assistance	1
in	1
the	1
church,	1
were	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
ever	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
situation	1
to	1
receive	1
it,	1
and	1
accepted	1
in	1
return	1
three	1
thousand	1
pounds.	1
All	1
connection	1
between	1
us	1
seemed	1
now	1
dissolved.	1
I	1
thought	1
too	1
ill	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
invite	1
him	1
to	1
Pemberley,	1
or	1
admit	1
his	1
society	1
in	1
town.	1
In	1
town	1
I	1
believe	1
he	1
chiefly	1
lived,	1
but	1
his	1
studying	1
the	1
law	1
was	1
a	1
mere	1
pretence,	1
and	1
being	1
now	1
free	1
from	1
all	1
restraint,	1
his	1
life	1
was	1
a	1
life	1
of	1
idleness	1
and	1
dissipation.	1
For	1
about	1
three	1
years	1
I	1
heard	1
little	1
of	1
him;	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
decease	1
of	1
the	1
incumbent	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
designed	1
for	1
him,	1
he	1
applied	1
to	1
me	1
again	1
by	1
letter	1
for	1
the	1
presentation.	1
His	1
circumstances,	1
he	1
assured	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
believing	1
it,	1
were	1
exceedingly	1
bad.	1
He	1
had	1
found	1
the	1
law	1
a	1
most	1
unprofitable	1
study,	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
absolutely	1
resolved	1
on	1
being	1
ordained,	1
if	1
I	1
would	1
present	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
living	1
in	1
question--of	1
which	1
he	1
trusted	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
little	1
doubt,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
well	1
assured	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
person	1
to	1
provide	1
for,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
forgotten	1
my	1
revered	1
father's	1
intentions.	1
You	1
will	1
hardly	1
blame	1
me	1
for	1
refusing	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
this	1
entreaty,	1
or	1
for	1
resisting	1
every	1
repetition	1
to	1
it.	1
His	1
resentment	1
was	1
in	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
distress	1
of	1
his	1
circumstances--and	1
he	1
was	1
doubtless	1
as	1
violent	1
in	1
his	1
abuse	1
of	1
me	1
to	1
others	1
as	1
in	1
his	1
reproaches	1
to	1
myself.	1
After	1
this	1
period	1
every	1
appearance	1
of	1
acquaintance	1
was	1
dropped.	1
How	1
he	1
lived	1
I	1
know	1
not.	1
But	1
last	1
summer	1
he	1
was	1
again	1
most	1
painfully	1
obtruded	1
on	1
my	1
notice.	1
"I	1
must	1
now	1
mention	1
a	1
circumstance	1
which	1
I	1
would	1
wish	1
to	1
forget	1
myself,	1
and	1
which	1
no	1
obligation	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
present	1
should	1
induce	1
me	1
to	1
unfold	1
to	1
any	1
human	1
being.	1
Having	1
said	1
thus	1
much,	1
I	1
feel	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
your	1
secrecy.	1
My	1
sister,	1
who	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
years	1
my	1
junior,	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
guardianship	1
of	1
my	1
mother's	1
nephew,	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam,	1
and	1
myself.	1
About	1
a	1
year	1
ago,	1
she	1
was	1
taken	1
from	1
school,	1
and	1
an	1
establishment	1
formed	1
for	1
her	1
in	1
London;	1
and	1
last	1
summer	1
she	1
went	1
with	1
the	1
lady	1
who	1
presided	1
over	1
it,	1
to	1
Ramsgate;	1
and	1
thither	1
also	1
went	1
Mr.	1
Wickham,	1
undoubtedly	1
by	1
design;	1
for	1
there	1
proved	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
prior	1
acquaintance	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Younge,	1
in	1
whose	1
character	1
we	1
were	1
most	1
unhappily	1
deceived;	1
and	1
by	1
her	1
connivance	1
and	1
aid,	1
he	1
so	1
far	1
recommended	1
himself	1
to	1
Georgiana,	1
whose	1
affectionate	1
heart	1
retained	1
a	1
strong	1
impression	1
of	1
his	1
kindness	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
a	1
child,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
persuaded	1
to	1
believe	1
herself	1
in	1
love,	1
and	1
to	1
consent	1
to	1
an	1
elopement.	1
She	1
was	1
then	1
but	1
fifteen,	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
her	1
excuse;	1
and	1
after	1
stating	1
her	1
imprudence,	1
I	1
am	1
happy	1
to	1
add,	1
that	1
I	1
owed	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
herself.	1
I	1
joined	1
them	1
unexpectedly	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
before	1
the	1
intended	1
elopement,	1
and	1
then	1
Georgiana,	1
unable	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
grieving	1
and	1
offending	1
a	1
brother	1
whom	1
she	1
almost	1
looked	1
up	1
to	1
as	1
a	1
father,	1
acknowledged	1
the	1
whole	1
to	1
me.	1
You	1
may	1
imagine	1
what	1
I	1
felt	1
and	1
how	1
I	1
acted.	1
Regard	1
for	1
my	1
sister's	1
credit	1
and	1
feelings	1
prevented	1
any	1
public	1
exposure;	1
but	1
I	1
wrote	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Wickham,	1
who	1
left	1
the	1
place	1
immediately,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Younge	1
was	1
of	1
course	1
removed	1
from	1
her	1
charge.	1
Mr.	1
Wickham's	1
chief	1
object	1
was	1
unquestionably	1
my	1
sister's	1
fortune,	1
which	1
is	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
pounds;	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
supposing	1
that	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
revenging	1
himself	1
on	1
me	1
was	1
a	1
strong	1
inducement.	1
His	1
revenge	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
complete	1
indeed.	1
"This,	1
madam,	1
is	1
a	1
faithful	1
narrative	1
of	1
every	1
event	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
concerned	1
together;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
absolutely	1
reject	1
it	1
as	1
false,	1
you	1
will,	1
I	1
hope,	1
acquit	1
me	1
henceforth	1
of	1
cruelty	1
towards	1
Mr.	1
Wickham.	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
in	1
what	1
manner,	1
under	1
what	1
form	1
of	1
falsehood	1
he	1
had	1
imposed	1
on	1
you;	1
but	1
his	1
success	1
is	1
not	1
perhaps	1
to	1
be	1
wondered	1
at.	1
Ignorant	1
as	1
you	1
previously	1
were	1
of	1
everything	1
concerning	1
either,	1
detection	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
your	1
power,	1
and	1
suspicion	1
certainly	1
not	1
in	1
your	1
inclination.	1
"You	1
may	1
possibly	1
wonder	1
why	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
told	1
you	1
last	1
night;	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
then	1
master	1
enough	1
of	1
myself	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
could	1
or	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
revealed.	1
For	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
everything	1
here	1
related,	1
I	1
can	1
appeal	1
more	1
particularly	1
to	1
the	1
testimony	1
of	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam,	1
who,	1
from	1
our	1
near	1
relationship	1
and	1
constant	1
intimacy,	1
and,	1
still	1
more,	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
executors	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
will,	1
has	1
been	1
unavoidably	1
acquainted	1
with	1
every	1
particular	1
of	1
these	1
transactions.	1
If	1
your	1
abhorrence	1
of	1
_me_	1
should	1
make	1
_my_	1
assertions	1
valueless,	1
you	1
cannot	1
be	1
prevented	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
cause	1
from	1
confiding	1
in	1
my	1
cousin;	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
consulting	1
him,	1
I	1
shall	1
endeavour	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
opportunity	1
of	1
putting	1
this	1
letter	1
in	1
your	1
hands	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
morning.	1
I	1
will	1
only	1
add,	1
God	1
bless	1
you.	1
"FITZWILLIAM	1
DARCY"	1
Chapter	1
36	1
If	1
Elizabeth,	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
letter,	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
it	1
to	1
contain	1
a	1
renewal	1
of	1
his	1
offers,	1
she	1
had	1
formed	1
no	1
expectation	1
at	1
all	1
of	1
its	1
contents.	1
But	1
such	1
as	1
they	1
were,	1
it	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
supposed	1
how	1
eagerly	1
she	1
went	1
through	1
them,	1
and	1
what	1
a	1
contrariety	1
of	1
emotion	1
they	1
excited.	1
Her	1
feelings	1
as	1
she	1
read	1
were	1
scarcely	1
to	1
be	1
defined.	1
With	1
amazement	1
did	1
she	1
first	1
understand	1
that	1
he	1
believed	1
any	1
apology	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
his	1
power;	1
and	1
steadfastly	1
was	1
she	1
persuaded,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
explanation	1
to	1
give,	1
which	1
a	1
just	1
sense	1
of	1
shame	1
would	1
not	1
conceal.	1
With	1
a	1
strong	1
prejudice	1
against	1
everything	1
he	1
might	1
say,	1
she	1
began	1
his	1
account	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
at	1
Netherfield.	1
She	1
read	1
with	1
an	1
eagerness	1
which	1
hardly	1
left	1
her	1
power	1
of	1
comprehension,	1
and	1
from	1
impatience	1
of	1
knowing	1
what	1
the	1
next	1
sentence	1
might	1
bring,	1
was	1
incapable	1
of	1
attending	1
to	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
before	1
her	1
eyes.	1
His	1
belief	1
of	1
her	1
sister's	1
insensibility	1
she	1
instantly	1
resolved	1
to	1
be	1
false;	1
and	1
his	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
real,	1
the	1
worst	1
objections	1
to	1
the	1
match,	1
made	1
her	1
too	1
angry	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
wish	1
of	1
doing	1
him	1
justice.	1
He	1
expressed	1
no	1
regret	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
which	1
satisfied	1
her;	1
his	1
style	1
was	1
not	1
penitent,	1
but	1
haughty.	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
pride	1
and	1
insolence.	1
But	1
when	1
this	1
subject	1
was	1
succeeded	1
by	1
his	1
account	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Wickham--when	1
she	1
read	1
with	1
somewhat	1
clearer	1
attention	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
events	1
which,	1
if	1
true,	1
must	1
overthrow	1
every	1
cherished	1
opinion	1
of	1
his	1
worth,	1
and	1
which	1
bore	1
so	1
alarming	1
an	1
affinity	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
history	1
of	1
himself--her	1
feelings	1
were	1
yet	1
more	1
acutely	1
painful	1
and	1
more	1
difficult	1
of	1
definition.	1
Astonishment,	1
apprehension,	1
and	1
even	1
horror,	1
oppressed	1
her.	1
She	1
wished	1
to	1
discredit	1
it	1
entirely,	1
repeatedly	1
exclaiming,	1
"This	1
must	1
be	1
false!	1
This	1
cannot	1
be!	1
This	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
grossest	1
falsehood!"--and	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
letter,	1
though	1
scarcely	1
knowing	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
page	1
or	1
two,	1
put	1
it	1
hastily	1
away,	1
protesting	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
regard	1
it,	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
look	1
in	1
it	1
again.	1
In	1
this	1
perturbed	1
state	1
of	1
mind,	1
with	1
thoughts	1
that	1
could	1
rest	1
on	1
nothing,	1
she	1
walked	1
on;	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
do;	1
in	1
half	1
a	1
minute	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
unfolded	1
again,	1
and	1
collecting	1
herself	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
she	1
again	1
began	1
the	1
mortifying	1
perusal	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
related	1
to	1
Wickham,	1
and	1
commanded	1
herself	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
every	1
sentence.	1
The	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
Pemberley	1
family	1
was	1
exactly	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
related	1
himself;	1
and	1
the	1
kindness	1
of	1
the	1
late	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
before	1
known	1
its	1
extent,	1
agreed	1
equally	1
well	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
words.	1
So	1
far	1
each	1
recital	1
confirmed	1
the	1
other;	1
but	1
when	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
will,	1
the	1
difference	1
was	1
great.	1
What	1
Wickham	1
had	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
living	1
was	1
fresh	1
in	1
her	1
memory,	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
recalled	1
his	1
very	1
words,	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
gross	1
duplicity	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
or	1
the	1
other;	1
and,	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments,	1
she	1
flattered	1
herself	1
that	1
her	1
wishes	1
did	1
not	1
err.	1
But	1
when	1
she	1
read	1
and	1
re-read	1
with	1
the	1
closest	1
attention,	1
the	1
particulars	1
immediately	1
following	1
of	1
Wickham's	1
resigning	1
all	1
pretensions	1
to	1
the	1
living,	1
of	1
his	1
receiving	1
in	1
lieu	1
so	1
considerable	1
a	1
sum	1
as	1
three	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
again	1
was	1
she	1
forced	1
to	1
hesitate.	1
She	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
letter,	1
weighed	1
every	1
circumstance	1
with	1
what	1
she	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
impartiality--deliberated	1
on	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
each	1
statement--but	1
with	1
little	1
success.	1
On	1
both	1
sides	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
assertion.	1
Again	1
she	1
read	1
on;	1
but	1
every	1
line	1
proved	1
more	1
clearly	1
that	1
the	1
affair,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
believed	1
it	1
impossible	1
that	1
any	1
contrivance	1
could	1
so	1
represent	1
as	1
to	1
render	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
conduct	1
in	1
it	1
less	1
than	1
infamous,	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
a	1
turn	1
which	1
must	1
make	1
him	1
entirely	1
blameless	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole.	1
The	1
extravagance	1
and	1
general	1
profligacy	1
which	1
he	1
scrupled	1
not	1
to	1
lay	1
at	1
Mr.	1
Wickham's	1
charge,	1
exceedingly	1
shocked	1
her;	1
the	1
more	1
so,	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
bring	1
no	1
proof	1
of	1
its	1
injustice.	1
She	1
had	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
him	1
before	1
his	1
entrance	1
into	1
the	1
----shire	1
Militia,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
engaged	1
at	1
the	1
persuasion	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
who,	1
on	1
meeting	1
him	1
accidentally	1
in	1
town,	1
had	1
there	1
renewed	1
a	1
slight	1
acquaintance.	1
Of	1
his	1
former	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
nothing	1
had	1
been	1
known	1
in	1
Hertfordshire	1
but	1
what	1
he	1
told	1
himself.	1
As	1
to	1
his	1
real	1
character,	1
had	1
information	1
been	1
in	1
her	1
power,	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
felt	1
a	1
wish	1
of	1
inquiring.	1
His	1
countenance,	1
voice,	1
and	1
manner	1
had	1
established	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
every	1
virtue.	1
She	1
tried	1
to	1
recollect	1
some	1
instance	1
of	1
goodness,	1
some	1
distinguished	1
trait	1
of	1
integrity	1
or	1
benevolence,	1
that	1
might	1
rescue	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
attacks	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy;	1
or	1
at	1
least,	1
by	1
the	1
predominance	1
of	1
virtue,	1
atone	1
for	1
those	1
casual	1
errors	1
under	1
which	1
she	1
would	1
endeavour	1
to	1
class	1
what	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
had	1
described	1
as	1
the	1
idleness	1
and	1
vice	1
of	1
many	1
years'	1
continuance.	1
But	1
no	1
such	1
recollection	1
befriended	1
her.	1
She	1
could	1
see	1
him	1
instantly	1
before	1
her,	1
in	1
every	1
charm	1
of	1
air	1
and	1
address;	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
remember	1
no	1
more	1
substantial	1
good	1
than	1
the	1
general	1
approbation	1
of	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
and	1
the	1
regard	1
which	1
his	1
social	1
powers	1
had	1
gained	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
mess.	1
After	1
pausing	1
on	1
this	1
point	1
a	1
considerable	1
while,	1
she	1
once	1
more	1
continued	1
to	1
read.	1
But,	1
alas!	1
the	1
story	1
which	1
followed,	1
of	1
his	1
designs	1
on	1
Miss	1
Darcy,	1
received	1
some	1
confirmation	1
from	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
and	1
herself	1
only	1
the	1
morning	1
before;	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
was	1
referred	1
for	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
every	1
particular	1
to	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
himself--from	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
previously	1
received	1
the	1
information	1
of	1
his	1
near	1
concern	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
cousin's	1
affairs,	1
and	1
whose	1
character	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
question.	1
At	1
one	1
time	1
she	1
had	1
almost	1
resolved	1
on	1
applying	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
the	1
idea	1
was	1
checked	1
by	1
the	1
awkwardness	1
of	1
the	1
application,	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
wholly	1
banished	1
by	1
the	1
conviction	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
hazarded	1
such	1
a	1
proposal,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
well	1
assured	1
of	1
his	1
cousin's	1
corroboration.	1
She	1
perfectly	1
remembered	1
everything	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
in	1
conversation	1
between	1
Wickham	1
and	1
herself,	1
in	1
their	1
first	1
evening	1
at	1
Mr.	1
Phillips's.	1
Many	1
of	1
his	1
expressions	1
were	1
still	1
fresh	1
in	1
her	1
memory.	1
She	1
was	1
_now_	1
struck	1
with	1
the	1
impropriety	1
of	1
such	1
communications	1
to	1
a	1
stranger,	1
and	1
wondered	1
it	1
had	1
escaped	1
her	1
before.	1
She	1
saw	1
the	1
indelicacy	1
of	1
putting	1
himself	1
forward	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done,	1
and	1
the	1
inconsistency	1
of	1
his	1
professions	1
with	1
his	1
conduct.	1
She	1
remembered	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
boasted	1
of	1
having	1
no	1
fear	1
of	1
seeing	1
Mr.	1
Darcy--that	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
might	1
leave	1
the	1
country,	1
but	1
that	1
_he_	1
should	1
stand	1
his	1
ground;	1
yet	1
he	1
had	1
avoided	1
the	1
Netherfield	1
ball	1
the	1
very	1
next	1
week.	1
She	1
remembered	1
also	1
that,	1
till	1
the	1
Netherfield	1
family	1
had	1
quitted	1
the	1
country,	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
his	1
story	1
to	1
no	1
one	1
but	1
herself;	1
but	1
that	1
after	1
their	1
removal	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
everywhere	1
discussed;	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
then	1
no	1
reserves,	1
no	1
scruples	1
in	1
sinking	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
character,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
respect	1
for	1
the	1
father	1
would	1
always	1
prevent	1
his	1
exposing	1
the	1
son.	1
How	1
differently	1
did	1
everything	1
now	1
appear	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
concerned!	1
His	1
attentions	1
to	1
Miss	1
King	1
were	1
now	1
the	1
consequence	1
of	1
views	1
solely	1
and	1
hatefully	1
mercenary;	1
and	1
the	1
mediocrity	1
of	1
her	1
fortune	1
proved	1
no	1
longer	1
the	1
moderation	1
of	1
his	1
wishes,	1
but	1
his	1
eagerness	1
to	1
grasp	1
at	1
anything.	1
His	1
behaviour	1
to	1
herself	1
could	1
now	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
tolerable	1
motive;	1
he	1
had	1
either	1
been	1
deceived	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
her	1
fortune,	1
or	1
had	1
been	1
gratifying	1
his	1
vanity	1
by	1
encouraging	1
the	1
preference	1
which	1
she	1
believed	1
she	1
had	1
most	1
incautiously	1
shown.	1
Every	1
lingering	1
struggle	1
in	1
his	1
favour	1
grew	1
fainter	1
and	1
fainter;	1
and	1
in	1
farther	1
justification	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
allow	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
when	1
questioned	1
by	1
Jane,	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
asserted	1
his	1
blamelessness	1
in	1
the	1
affair;	1
that	1
proud	1
and	1
repulsive	1
as	1
were	1
his	1
manners,	1
she	1
had	1
never,	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
their	1
acquaintance--an	1
acquaintance	1
which	1
had	1
latterly	1
brought	1
them	1
much	1
together,	1
and	1
given	1
her	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
intimacy	1
with	1
his	1
ways--seen	1
anything	1
that	1
betrayed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
unprincipled	1
or	1
unjust--anything	1
that	1
spoke	1
him	1
of	1
irreligious	1
or	1
immoral	1
habits;	1
that	1
among	1
his	1
own	1
connections	1
he	1
was	1
esteemed	1
and	1
valued--that	1
even	1
Wickham	1
had	1
allowed	1
him	1
merit	1
as	1
a	1
brother,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
often	1
heard	1
him	1
speak	1
so	1
affectionately	1
of	1
his	1
sister	1
as	1
to	1
prove	1
him	1
capable	1
of	1
_some_	1
amiable	1
feeling;	1
that	1
had	1
his	1
actions	1
been	1
what	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
represented	1
them,	1
so	1
gross	1
a	1
violation	1
of	1
everything	1
right	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
been	1
concealed	1
from	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
that	1
friendship	1
between	1
a	1
person	1
capable	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
such	1
an	1
amiable	1
man	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
was	1
incomprehensible.	1
She	1
grew	1
absolutely	1
ashamed	1
of	1
herself.	1
Of	1
neither	1
Darcy	1
nor	1
Wickham	1
could	1
she	1
think	1
without	1
feeling	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
blind,	1
partial,	1
prejudiced,	1
absurd.	1
"How	1
despicably	1
I	1
have	1
acted!"	1
she	1
cried;	1
"I,	1
who	1
have	1
prided	1
myself	1
on	1
my	1
discernment!	1
I,	1
who	1
have	1
valued	1
myself	1
on	1
my	1
abilities!	1
who	1
have	1
often	1
disdained	1
the	1
generous	1
candour	1
of	1
my	1
sister,	1
and	1
gratified	1
my	1
vanity	1
in	1
useless	1
or	1
blameable	1
mistrust!	1
How	1
humiliating	1
is	1
this	1
discovery!	1
Yet,	1
how	1
just	1
a	1
humiliation!	1
Had	1
I	1
been	1
in	1
love,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
wretchedly	1
blind!	1
But	1
vanity,	1
not	1
love,	1
has	1
been	1
my	1
folly.	1
Pleased	1
with	1
the	1
preference	1
of	1
one,	1
and	1
offended	1
by	1
the	1
neglect	1
of	1
the	1
other,	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
beginning	1
of	1
our	1
acquaintance,	1
I	1
have	1
courted	1
prepossession	1
and	1
ignorance,	1
and	1
driven	1
reason	1
away,	1
where	1
either	1
were	1
concerned.	1
Till	1
this	1
moment	1
I	1
never	1
knew	1
myself."	1
From	1
herself	1
to	1
Jane--from	1
Jane	1
to	1
Bingley,	1
her	1
thoughts	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
line	1
which	1
soon	1
brought	1
to	1
her	1
recollection	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
explanation	1
_there_	1
had	1
appeared	1
very	1
insufficient,	1
and	1
she	1
read	1
it	1
again.	1
Widely	1
different	1
was	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
a	1
second	1
perusal.	1
How	1
could	1
she	1
deny	1
that	1
credit	1
to	1
his	1
assertions	1
in	1
one	1
instance,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
give	1
in	1
the	1
other?	1
He	1
declared	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
totally	1
unsuspicious	1
of	1
her	1
sister's	1
attachment;	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
remembering	1
what	1
Charlotte's	1
opinion	1
had	1
always	1
been.	1
Neither	1
could	1
she	1
deny	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
his	1
description	1
of	1
Jane.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
Jane's	1
feelings,	1
though	1
fervent,	1
were	1
little	1
displayed,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
constant	1
complacency	1
in	1
her	1
air	1
and	1
manner	1
not	1
often	1
united	1
with	1
great	1
sensibility.	1
When	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
family	1
were	1
mentioned	1
in	1
terms	1
of	1
such	1
mortifying,	1
yet	1
merited	1
reproach,	1
her	1
sense	1
of	1
shame	1
was	1
severe.	1
The	1
justice	1
of	1
the	1
charge	1
struck	1
her	1
too	1
forcibly	1
for	1
denial,	1
and	1
the	1
circumstances	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
particularly	1
alluded	1
as	1
having	1
passed	1
at	1
the	1
Netherfield	1
ball,	1
and	1
as	1
confirming	1
all	1
his	1
first	1
disapprobation,	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
stronger	1
impression	1
on	1
his	1
mind	1
than	1
on	1
hers.	1
The	1
compliment	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
was	1
not	1
unfelt.	1
It	1
soothed,	1
but	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
console	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
contempt	1
which	1
had	1
thus	1
been	1
self-attracted	1
by	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
her	1
family;	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
considered	1
that	1
Jane's	1
disappointment	1
had	1
in	1
fact	1
been	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
her	1
nearest	1
relations,	1
and	1
reflected	1
how	1
materially	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
both	1
must	1
be	1
hurt	1
by	1
such	1
impropriety	1
of	1
conduct,	1
she	1
felt	1
depressed	1
beyond	1
anything	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
known	1
before.	1
After	1
wandering	1
along	1
the	1
lane	1
for	1
two	1
hours,	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
every	1
variety	1
of	1
thought--re-considering	1
events,	1
determining	1
probabilities,	1
and	1
reconciling	1
herself,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
to	1
a	1
change	1
so	1
sudden	1
and	1
so	1
important,	1
fatigue,	1
and	1
a	1
recollection	1
of	1
her	1
long	1
absence,	1
made	1
her	1
at	1
length	1
return	1
home;	1
and	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
the	1
wish	1
of	1
appearing	1
cheerful	1
as	1
usual,	1
and	1
the	1
resolution	1
of	1
repressing	1
such	1
reflections	1
as	1
must	1
make	1
her	1
unfit	1
for	1
conversation.	1
She	1
was	1
immediately	1
told	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
from	1
Rosings	1
had	1
each	1
called	1
during	1
her	1
absence;	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
only	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
to	1
take	1
leave--but	1
that	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
with	1
them	1
at	1
least	1
an	1
hour,	1
hoping	1
for	1
her	1
return,	1
and	1
almost	1
resolving	1
to	1
walk	1
after	1
her	1
till	1
she	1
could	1
be	1
found.	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
but	1
just	1
_affect_	1
concern	1
in	1
missing	1
him;	1
she	1
really	1
rejoiced	1
at	1
it.	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
an	1
object;	1
she	1
could	1
think	1
only	1
of	1
her	1
letter.	1
Chapter	1
37	1
The	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
left	1
Rosings	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
having	1
been	1
in	1
waiting	1
near	1
the	1
lodges,	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
his	1
parting	1
obeisance,	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
bring	1
home	1
the	1
pleasing	1
intelligence,	1
of	1
their	1
appearing	1
in	1
very	1
good	1
health,	1
and	1
in	1
as	1
tolerable	1
spirits	1
as	1
could	1
be	1
expected,	1
after	1
the	1
melancholy	1
scene	1
so	1
lately	1
gone	1
through	1
at	1
Rosings.	1
To	1
Rosings	1
he	1
then	1
hastened,	1
to	1
console	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
and	1
her	1
daughter;	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
return	1
brought	1
back,	1
with	1
great	1
satisfaction,	1
a	1
message	1
from	1
her	1
ladyship,	1
importing	1
that	1
she	1
felt	1
herself	1
so	1
dull	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
very	1
desirous	1
of	1
having	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
her.	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
without	1
recollecting	1
that,	1
had	1
she	1
chosen	1
it,	1
she	1
might	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
have	1
been	1
presented	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
her	1
future	1
niece;	1
nor	1
could	1
she	1
think,	1
without	1
a	1
smile,	1
of	1
what	1
her	1
ladyship's	1
indignation	1
would	1
have	1
been.	1
"What	1
would	1
she	1
have	1
said?	1
how	1
would	1
she	1
have	1
behaved?"	1
were	1
questions	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
amused	1
herself.	1
Their	1
first	1
subject	1
was	1
the	1
diminution	1
of	1
the	1
Rosings	1
party.	1
"I	1
assure	1
you,	1
I	1
feel	1
it	1
exceedingly,"	1
said	1
Lady	1
Catherine;	1
"I	1
believe	1
no	1
one	1
feels	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
friends	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
do.	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
particularly	1
attached	1
to	1
these	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
know	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
much	1
attached	1
to	1
me!	1
They	1
were	1
excessively	1
sorry	1
to	1
go!	1
But	1
so	1
they	1
always	1
are.	1
The	1
dear	1
Colonel	1
rallied	1
his	1
spirits	1
tolerably	1
till	1
just	1
at	1
last;	1
but	1
Darcy	1
seemed	1
to	1
feel	1
it	1
most	1
acutely,	1
more,	1
I	1
think,	1
than	1
last	1
year.	1
His	1
attachment	1
to	1
Rosings	1
certainly	1
increases."	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
had	1
a	1
compliment,	1
and	1
an	1
allusion	1
to	1
throw	1
in	1
here,	1
which	1
were	1
kindly	1
smiled	1
on	1
by	1
the	1
mother	1
and	1
daughter.	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
observed,	1
after	1
dinner,	1
that	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
seemed	1
out	1
of	1
spirits,	1
and	1
immediately	1
accounting	1
for	1
it	1
by	1
herself,	1
by	1
supposing	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
again	1
so	1
soon,	1
she	1
added:	1
"But	1
if	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
case,	1
you	1
must	1
write	1
to	1
your	1
mother	1
and	1
beg	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
stay	1
a	1
little	1
longer.	1
Mrs.	1
Collins	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
of	1
your	1
company,	1
I	1
am	1
sure."	1
"I	1
am	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
your	1
ladyship	1
for	1
your	1
kind	1
invitation,"	1
replied	1
Elizabeth,	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
accept	1
it.	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
town	1
next	1
Saturday."	1
"Why,	1
at	1
that	1
rate,	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
been	1
here	1
only	1
six	1
weeks.	1
I	1
expected	1
you	1
to	1
stay	1
two	1
months.	1
I	1
told	1
Mrs.	1
Collins	1
so	1
before	1
you	1
came.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
your	1
going	1
so	1
soon.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
could	1
certainly	1
spare	1
you	1
for	1
another	1
fortnight."	1
"But	1
my	1
father	1
cannot.	1
He	1
wrote	1
last	1
week	1
to	1
hurry	1
my	1
return."	1
"Oh!	1
your	1
father	1
of	1
course	1
may	1
spare	1
you,	1
if	1
your	1
mother	1
can.	1
Daughters	1
are	1
never	1
of	1
so	1
much	1
consequence	1
to	1
a	1
father.	1
And	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
stay	1
another	1
_month_	1
complete,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
take	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
London,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
there	1
early	1
in	1
June,	1
for	1
a	1
week;	1
and	1
as	1
Dawson	1
does	1
not	1
object	1
to	1
the	1
barouche-box,	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
good	1
room	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
you--and	1
indeed,	1
if	1
the	1
weather	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
cool,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
object	1
to	1
taking	1
you	1
both,	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
neither	1
of	1
you	1
large."	1
"You	1
are	1
all	1
kindness,	1
madam;	1
but	1
I	1
believe	1
we	1
must	1
abide	1
by	1
our	1
original	1
plan."	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
seemed	1
resigned.	1
"Mrs.	1
Collins,	1
you	1
must	1
send	1
a	1
servant	1
with	1
them.	1
You	1
know	1
I	1
always	1
speak	1
my	1
mind,	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
bear	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
two	1
young	1
women	1
travelling	1
post	1
by	1
themselves.	1
It	1
is	1
highly	1
improper.	1
You	1
must	1
contrive	1
to	1
send	1
somebody.	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
greatest	1
dislike	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
thing.	1
Young	1
women	1
should	1
always	1
be	1
properly	1
guarded	1
and	1
attended,	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
situation	1
in	1
life.	1
When	1
my	1
niece	1
Georgiana	1
went	1
to	1
Ramsgate	1
last	1
summer,	1
I	1
made	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
her	1
having	1
two	1
men-servants	1
go	1
with	1
her.	1
Miss	1
Darcy,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
of	1
Pemberley,	1
and	1
Lady	1
Anne,	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
appeared	1
with	1
propriety	1
in	1
a	1
different	1
manner.	1
I	1
am	1
excessively	1
attentive	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
things.	1
You	1
must	1
send	1
John	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
ladies,	1
Mrs.	1
Collins.	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
mention	1
it;	1
for	1
it	1
would	1
really	1
be	1
discreditable	1
to	1
_you_	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
alone."	1
"My	1
uncle	1
is	1
to	1
send	1
a	1
servant	1
for	1
us."	1
"Oh!	1
Your	1
uncle!	1
He	1
keeps	1
a	1
man-servant,	1
does	1
he?	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
you	1
have	1
somebody	1
who	1
thinks	1
of	1
these	1
things.	1
Where	1
shall	1
you	1
change	1
horses?	1
Oh!	1
Bromley,	1
of	1
course.	1
If	1
you	1
mention	1
my	1
name	1
at	1
the	1
Bell,	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
attended	1
to."	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
had	1
many	1
other	1
questions	1
to	1
ask	1
respecting	1
their	1
journey,	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
them	1
all	1
herself,	1
attention	1
was	1
necessary,	1
which	1
Elizabeth	1
believed	1
to	1
be	1
lucky	1
for	1
her;	1
or,	1
with	1
a	1
mind	1
so	1
occupied,	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
forgotten	1
where	1
she	1
was.	1
Reflection	1
must	1
be	1
reserved	1
for	1
solitary	1
hours;	1
whenever	1
she	1
was	1
alone,	1
she	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
greatest	1
relief;	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
day	1
went	1
by	1
without	1
a	1
solitary	1
walk,	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
might	1
indulge	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
unpleasant	1
recollections.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
letter	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
fair	1
way	1
of	1
soon	1
knowing	1
by	1
heart.	1
She	1
studied	1
every	1
sentence;	1
and	1
her	1
feelings	1
towards	1
its	1
writer	1
were	1
at	1
times	1
widely	1
different.	1
When	1
she	1
remembered	1
the	1
style	1
of	1
his	1
address,	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
full	1
of	1
indignation;	1
but	1
when	1
she	1
considered	1
how	1
unjustly	1
she	1
had	1
condemned	1
and	1
upbraided	1
him,	1
her	1
anger	1
was	1
turned	1
against	1
herself;	1
and	1
his	1
disappointed	1
feelings	1
became	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
compassion.	1
His	1
attachment	1
excited	1
gratitude,	1
his	1
general	1
character	1
respect;	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
approve	1
him;	1
nor	1
could	1
she	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
repent	1
her	1
refusal,	1
or	1
feel	1
the	1
slightest	1
inclination	1
ever	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
again.	1
In	1
her	1
own	1
past	1
behaviour,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
constant	1
source	1
of	1
vexation	1
and	1
regret;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
unhappy	1
defects	1
of	1
her	1
family,	1
a	1
subject	1
of	1
yet	1
heavier	1
chagrin.	1
They	1
were	1
hopeless	1
of	1
remedy.	1
Her	1
father,	1
contented	1
with	1
laughing	1
at	1
them,	1
would	1
never	1
exert	1
himself	1
to	1
restrain	1
the	1
wild	1
giddiness	1
of	1
his	1
youngest	1
daughters;	1
and	1
her	1
mother,	1
with	1
manners	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
right	1
herself,	1
was	1
entirely	1
insensible	1
of	1
the	1
evil.	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
frequently	1
united	1
with	1
Jane	1
in	1
an	1
endeavour	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
imprudence	1
of	1
Catherine	1
and	1
Lydia;	1
but	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
supported	1
by	1
their	1
mother's	1
indulgence,	1
what	1
chance	1
could	1
there	1
be	1
of	1
improvement?	1
Catherine,	1
weak-spirited,	1
irritable,	1
and	1
completely	1
under	1
Lydia's	1
guidance,	1
had	1
been	1
always	1
affronted	1
by	1
their	1
advice;	1
and	1
Lydia,	1
self-willed	1
and	1
careless,	1
would	1
scarcely	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
hearing.	1
They	1
were	1
ignorant,	1
idle,	1
and	1
vain.	1
While	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
officer	1
in	1
Meryton,	1
they	1
would	1
flirt	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
while	1
Meryton	1
was	1
within	1
a	1
walk	1
of	1
Longbourn,	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
going	1
there	1
forever.	1
Anxiety	1
on	1
Jane's	1
behalf	1
was	1
another	1
prevailing	1
concern;	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
explanation,	1
by	1
restoring	1
Bingley	1
to	1
all	1
her	1
former	1
good	1
opinion,	1
heightened	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
what	1
Jane	1
had	1
lost.	1
His	1
affection	1
was	1
proved	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
sincere,	1
and	1
his	1
conduct	1
cleared	1
of	1
all	1
blame,	1
unless	1
any	1
could	1
attach	1
to	1
the	1
implicitness	1
of	1
his	1
confidence	1
in	1
his	1
friend.	1
How	1
grievous	1
then	1
was	1
the	1
thought	1
that,	1
of	1
a	1
situation	1
so	1
desirable	1
in	1
every	1
respect,	1
so	1
replete	1
with	1
advantage,	1
so	1
promising	1
for	1
happiness,	1
Jane	1
had	1
been	1
deprived,	1
by	1
the	1
folly	1
and	1
indecorum	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
family!	1
When	1
to	1
these	1
recollections	1
was	1
added	1
the	1
development	1
of	1
Wickham's	1
character,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
easily	1
believed	1
that	1
the	1
happy	1
spirits	1
which	1
had	1
seldom	1
been	1
depressed	1
before,	1
were	1
now	1
so	1
much	1
affected	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
almost	1
impossible	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
appear	1
tolerably	1
cheerful.	1
Their	1
engagements	1
at	1
Rosings	1
were	1
as	1
frequent	1
during	1
the	1
last	1
week	1
of	1
her	1
stay	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
first.	1
The	1
very	1
last	1
evening	1
was	1
spent	1
there;	1
and	1
her	1
ladyship	1
again	1
inquired	1
minutely	1
into	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
their	1
journey,	1
gave	1
them	1
directions	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
method	1
of	1
packing,	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
urgent	1
on	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
placing	1
gowns	1
in	1
the	1
only	1
right	1
way,	1
that	1
Maria	1
thought	1
herself	1
obliged,	1
on	1
her	1
return,	1
to	1
undo	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
pack	1
her	1
trunk	1
afresh.	1
When	1
they	1
parted,	1
Lady	1
Catherine,	1
with	1
great	1
condescension,	1
wished	1
them	1
a	1
good	1
journey,	1
and	1
invited	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Hunsford	1
again	1
next	1
year;	1
and	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh	1
exerted	1
herself	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
curtsey	1
and	1
hold	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
both.	1
Chapter	1
38	1
On	1
Saturday	1
morning	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
met	1
for	1
breakfast	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
before	1
the	1
others	1
appeared;	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
paying	1
the	1
parting	1
civilities	1
which	1
he	1
deemed	1
indispensably	1
necessary.	1
"I	1
know	1
not,	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"whether	1
Mrs.	1
Collins	1
has	1
yet	1
expressed	1
her	1
sense	1
of	1
your	1
kindness	1
in	1
coming	1
to	1
us;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
certain	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
the	1
house	1
without	1
receiving	1
her	1
thanks	1
for	1
it.	1
The	1
favour	1
of	1
your	1
company	1
has	1
been	1
much	1
felt,	1
I	1
assure	1
you.	1
We	1
know	1
how	1
little	1
there	1
is	1
to	1
tempt	1
anyone	1
to	1
our	1
humble	1
abode.	1
Our	1
plain	1
manner	1
of	1
living,	1
our	1
small	1
rooms	1
and	1
few	1
domestics,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
we	1
see	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
must	1
make	1
Hunsford	1
extremely	1
dull	1
to	1
a	1
young	1
lady	1
like	1
yourself;	1
but	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
believe	1
us	1
grateful	1
for	1
the	1
condescension,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
done	1
everything	1
in	1
our	1
power	1
to	1
prevent	1
your	1
spending	1
your	1
time	1
unpleasantly."	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
eager	1
with	1
her	1
thanks	1
and	1
assurances	1
of	1
happiness.	1
She	1
had	1
spent	1
six	1
weeks	1
with	1
great	1
enjoyment;	1
and	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
being	1
with	1
Charlotte,	1
and	1
the	1
kind	1
attentions	1
she	1
had	1
received,	1
must	1
make	1
_her_	1
feel	1
the	1
obliged.	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
was	1
gratified,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
smiling	1
solemnity	1
replied:	1
"It	1
gives	1
me	1
great	1
pleasure	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
passed	1
your	1
time	1
not	1
disagreeably.	1
We	1
have	1
certainly	1
done	1
our	1
best;	1
and	1
most	1
fortunately	1
having	1
it	1
in	1
our	1
power	1
to	1
introduce	1
you	1
to	1
very	1
superior	1
society,	1
and,	1
from	1
our	1
connection	1
with	1
Rosings,	1
the	1
frequent	1
means	1
of	1
varying	1
the	1
humble	1
home	1
scene,	1
I	1
think	1
we	1
may	1
flatter	1
ourselves	1
that	1
your	1
Hunsford	1
visit	1
cannot	1
have	1
been	1
entirely	1
irksome.	1
Our	1
situation	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
Lady	1
Catherine's	1
family	1
is	1
indeed	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
extraordinary	1
advantage	1
and	1
blessing	1
which	1
few	1
can	1
boast.	1
You	1
see	1
on	1
what	1
a	1
footing	1
we	1
are.	1
You	1
see	1
how	1
continually	1
we	1
are	1
engaged	1
there.	1
In	1
truth	1
I	1
must	1
acknowledge	1
that,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
disadvantages	1
of	1
this	1
humble	1
parsonage,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
think	1
anyone	1
abiding	1
in	1
it	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
compassion,	1
while	1
they	1
are	1
sharers	1
of	1
our	1
intimacy	1
at	1
Rosings."	1
Words	1
were	1
insufficient	1
for	1
the	1
elevation	1
of	1
his	1
feelings;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
walk	1
about	1
the	1
room,	1
while	1
Elizabeth	1
tried	1
to	1
unite	1
civility	1
and	1
truth	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
short	1
sentences.	1
"You	1
may,	1
in	1
fact,	1
carry	1
a	1
very	1
favourable	1
report	1
of	1
us	1
into	1
Hertfordshire,	1
my	1
dear	1
cousin.	1
I	1
flatter	1
myself	1
at	1
least	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
so.	1
Lady	1
Catherine's	1
great	1
attentions	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Collins	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
daily	1
witness	1
of;	1
and	1
altogether	1
I	1
trust	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
appear	1
that	1
your	1
friend	1
has	1
drawn	1
an	1
unfortunate--but	1
on	1
this	1
point	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
be	1
silent.	1
Only	1
let	1
me	1
assure	1
you,	1
my	1
dear	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth,	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
from	1
my	1
heart	1
most	1
cordially	1
wish	1
you	1
equal	1
felicity	1
in	1
marriage.	1
My	1
dear	1
Charlotte	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
but	1
one	1
mind	1
and	1
one	1
way	1
of	1
thinking.	1
There	1
is	1
in	1
everything	1
a	1
most	1
remarkable	1
resemblance	1
of	1
character	1
and	1
ideas	1
between	1
us.	1
We	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
designed	1
for	1
each	1
other."	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
safely	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
happiness	1
where	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
case,	1
and	1
with	1
equal	1
sincerity	1
could	1
add,	1
that	1
she	1
firmly	1
believed	1
and	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
his	1
domestic	1
comforts.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
sorry,	1
however,	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
recital	1
of	1
them	1
interrupted	1
by	1
the	1
lady	1
from	1
whom	1
they	1
sprang.	1
Poor	1
Charlotte!	1
it	1
was	1
melancholy	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
to	1
such	1
society!	1
But	1
she	1
had	1
chosen	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
open;	1
and	1
though	1
evidently	1
regretting	1
that	1
her	1
visitors	1
were	1
to	1
go,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
compassion.	1
Her	1
home	1
and	1
her	1
housekeeping,	1
her	1
parish	1
and	1
her	1
poultry,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
dependent	1
concerns,	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
lost	1
their	1
charms.	1
At	1
length	1
the	1
chaise	1
arrived,	1
the	1
trunks	1
were	1
fastened	1
on,	1
the	1
parcels	1
placed	1
within,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
pronounced	1
to	1
be	1
ready.	1
After	1
an	1
affectionate	1
parting	1
between	1
the	1
friends,	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
attended	1
to	1
the	1
carriage	1
by	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
walked	1
down	1
the	1
garden	1
he	1
was	1
commissioning	1
her	1
with	1
his	1
best	1
respects	1
to	1
all	1
her	1
family,	1
not	1
forgetting	1
his	1
thanks	1
for	1
the	1
kindness	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
in	1
the	1
winter,	1
and	1
his	1
compliments	1
to	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
though	1
unknown.	1
He	1
then	1
handed	1
her	1
in,	1
Maria	1
followed,	1
and	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
being	1
closed,	1
when	1
he	1
suddenly	1
reminded	1
them,	1
with	1
some	1
consternation,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
hitherto	1
forgotten	1
to	1
leave	1
any	1
message	1
for	1
the	1
ladies	1
at	1
Rosings.	1
"But,"	1
he	1
added,	1
"you	1
will	1
of	1
course	1
wish	1
to	1
have	1
your	1
humble	1
respects	1
delivered	1
to	1
them,	1
with	1
your	1
grateful	1
thanks	1
for	1
their	1
kindness	1
to	1
you	1
while	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
here."	1
Elizabeth	1
made	1
no	1
objection;	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
then	1
allowed	1
to	1
be	1
shut,	1
and	1
the	1
carriage	1
drove	1
off.	1
"Good	1
gracious!"	1
cried	1
Maria,	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
minutes'	1
silence,	1
"it	1
seems	1
but	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
since	1
we	1
first	1
came!	1
and	1
yet	1
how	1
many	1
things	1
have	1
happened!"	1
"A	1
great	1
many	1
indeed,"	1
said	1
her	1
companion	1
with	1
a	1
sigh.	1
"We	1
have	1
dined	1
nine	1
times	1
at	1
Rosings,	1
besides	1
drinking	1
tea	1
there	1
twice!	1
How	1
much	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
tell!"	1
Elizabeth	1
added	1
privately,	1
"And	1
how	1
much	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
conceal!"	1
Their	1
journey	1
was	1
performed	1
without	1
much	1
conversation,	1
or	1
any	1
alarm;	1
and	1
within	1
four	1
hours	1
of	1
their	1
leaving	1
Hunsford	1
they	1
reached	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner's	1
house,	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
remain	1
a	1
few	1
days.	1
Jane	1
looked	1
well,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
little	1
opportunity	1
of	1
studying	1
her	1
spirits,	1
amidst	1
the	1
various	1
engagements	1
which	1
the	1
kindness	1
of	1
her	1
aunt	1
had	1
reserved	1
for	1
them.	1
But	1
Jane	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
leisure	1
enough	1
for	1
observation.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
without	1
an	1
effort,	1
meanwhile,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
wait	1
even	1
for	1
Longbourn,	1
before	1
she	1
told	1
her	1
sister	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
proposals.	1
To	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
revealing	1
what	1
would	1
so	1
exceedingly	1
astonish	1
Jane,	1
and	1
must,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
so	1
highly	1
gratify	1
whatever	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
vanity	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
reason	1
away,	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
temptation	1
to	1
openness	1
as	1
nothing	1
could	1
have	1
conquered	1
but	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
indecision	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
remained	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
should	1
communicate;	1
and	1
her	1
fear,	1
if	1
she	1
once	1
entered	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
of	1
being	1
hurried	1
into	1
repeating	1
something	1
of	1
Bingley	1
which	1
might	1
only	1
grieve	1
her	1
sister	1
further.	1
Chapter	1
39	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
second	1
week	1
in	1
May,	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
three	1
young	1
ladies	1
set	1
out	1
together	1
from	1
Gracechurch	1
Street	1
for	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
----,	1
in	1
Hertfordshire;	1
and,	1
as	1
they	1
drew	1
near	1
the	1
appointed	1
inn	1
where	1
Mr.	1
Bennet's	1
carriage	1
was	1
to	1
meet	1
them,	1
they	1
quickly	1
perceived,	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
the	1
coachman's	1
punctuality,	1
both	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Lydia	1
looking	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
dining-room	1
up	1
stairs.	1
These	1
two	1
girls	1
had	1
been	1
above	1
an	1
hour	1
in	1
the	1
place,	1
happily	1
employed	1
in	1
visiting	1
an	1
opposite	1
milliner,	1
watching	1
the	1
sentinel	1
on	1
guard,	1
and	1
dressing	1
a	1
salad	1
and	1
cucumber.	1
After	1
welcoming	1
their	1
sisters,	1
they	1
triumphantly	1
displayed	1
a	1
table	1
set	1
out	1
with	1
such	1
cold	1
meat	1
as	1
an	1
inn	1
larder	1
usually	1
affords,	1
exclaiming,	1
"Is	1
not	1
this	1
nice?	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
an	1
agreeable	1
surprise?"	1
"And	1
we	1
mean	1
to	1
treat	1
you	1
all,"	1
added	1
Lydia,	1
"but	1
you	1
must	1
lend	1
us	1
the	1
money,	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
just	1
spent	1
ours	1
at	1
the	1
shop	1
out	1
there."	1
Then,	1
showing	1
her	1
purchases--"Look	1
here,	1
I	1
have	1
bought	1
this	1
bonnet.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
pretty;	1
but	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
buy	1
it	1
as	1
not.	1
I	1
shall	1
pull	1
it	1
to	1
pieces	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
get	1
home,	1
and	1
see	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
make	1
it	1
up	1
any	1
better."	1
And	1
when	1
her	1
sisters	1
abused	1
it	1
as	1
ugly,	1
she	1
added,	1
with	1
perfect	1
unconcern,	1
"Oh!	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
much	1
uglier	1
in	1
the	1
shop;	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
bought	1
some	1
prettier-coloured	1
satin	1
to	1
trim	1
it	1
with	1
fresh,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
tolerable.	1
Besides,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
much	1
signify	1
what	1
one	1
wears	1
this	1
summer,	1
after	1
the	1
----shire	1
have	1
left	1
Meryton,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
going	1
in	1
a	1
fortnight."	1
"Are	1
they	1
indeed!"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth,	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
satisfaction.	1
"They	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
encamped	1
near	1
Brighton;	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
so	1
want	1
papa	1
to	1
take	1
us	1
all	1
there	1
for	1
the	1
summer!	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
delicious	1
scheme;	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
would	1
hardly	1
cost	1
anything	1
at	1
all.	1
Mamma	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
too	1
of	1
all	1
things!	1
Only	1
think	1
what	1
a	1
miserable	1
summer	1
else	1
we	1
shall	1
have!"	1
"Yes,"	1
thought	1
Elizabeth,	1
"_that_	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
delightful	1
scheme	1
indeed,	1
and	1
completely	1
do	1
for	1
us	1
at	1
once.	1
Good	1
Heaven!	1
Brighton,	1
and	1
a	1
whole	1
campful	1
of	1
soldiers,	1
to	1
us,	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
overset	1
already	1
by	1
one	1
poor	1
regiment	1
of	1
militia,	1
and	1
the	1
monthly	1
balls	1
of	1
Meryton!"	1
"Now	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
some	1
news	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
Lydia,	1
as	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
at	1
table.	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
think?	1
It	1
is	1
excellent	1
news--capital	1
news--and	1
about	1
a	1
certain	1
person	1
we	1
all	1
like!"	1
Jane	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
the	1
waiter	1
was	1
told	1
he	1
need	1
not	1
stay.	1
Lydia	1
laughed,	1
and	1
said:	1
"Aye,	1
that	1
is	1
just	1
like	1
your	1
formality	1
and	1
discretion.	1
You	1
thought	1
the	1
waiter	1
must	1
not	1
hear,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
cared!	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
he	1
often	1
hears	1
worse	1
things	1
said	1
than	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
say.	1
But	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
ugly	1
fellow!	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
he	1
is	1
gone.	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
such	1
a	1
long	1
chin	1
in	1
my	1
life.	1
Well,	1
but	1
now	1
for	1
my	1
news;	1
it	1
is	1
about	1
dear	1
Wickham;	1
too	1
good	1
for	1
the	1
waiter,	1
is	1
it	1
not?	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
danger	1
of	1
Wickham's	1
marrying	1
Mary	1
King.	1
There's	1
for	1
you!	1
She	1
is	1
gone	1
down	1
to	1
her	1
uncle	1
at	1
Liverpool:	1
gone	1
to	1
stay.	1
Wickham	1
is	1
safe."	1
"And	1
Mary	1
King	1
is	1
safe!"	1
added	1
Elizabeth;	1
"safe	1
from	1
a	1
connection	1
imprudent	1
as	1
to	1
fortune."	1
"She	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
fool	1
for	1
going	1
away,	1
if	1
she	1
liked	1
him."	1
"But	1
I	1
hope	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
strong	1
attachment	1
on	1
either	1
side,"	1
said	1
Jane.	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
on	1
_his_.	1
I	1
will	1
answer	1
for	1
it,	1
he	1
never	1
cared	1
three	1
straws	1
about	1
her--who	1
could	1
about	1
such	1
a	1
nasty	1
little	1
freckled	1
thing?"	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
shocked	1
to	1
think	1
that,	1
however	1
incapable	1
of	1
such	1
coarseness	1
of	1
_expression_	1
herself,	1
the	1
coarseness	1
of	1
the	1
_sentiment_	1
was	1
little	1
other	1
than	1
her	1
own	1
breast	1
had	1
harboured	1
and	1
fancied	1
liberal!	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
all	1
had	1
ate,	1
and	1
the	1
elder	1
ones	1
paid,	1
the	1
carriage	1
was	1
ordered;	1
and	1
after	1
some	1
contrivance,	1
the	1
whole	1
party,	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
boxes,	1
work-bags,	1
and	1
parcels,	1
and	1
the	1
unwelcome	1
addition	1
of	1
Kitty's	1
and	1
Lydia's	1
purchases,	1
were	1
seated	1
in	1
it.	1
"How	1
nicely	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
crammed	1
in,"	1
cried	1
Lydia.	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
I	1
bought	1
my	1
bonnet,	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
fun	1
of	1
having	1
another	1
bandbox!	1
Well,	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
quite	1
comfortable	1
and	1
snug,	1
and	1
talk	1
and	1
laugh	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
home.	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place,	1
let	1
us	1
hear	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
you	1
all	1
since	1
you	1
went	1
away.	1
Have	1
you	1
seen	1
any	1
pleasant	1
men?	1
Have	1
you	1
had	1
any	1
flirting?	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
great	1
hopes	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
got	1
a	1
husband	1
before	1
you	1
came	1
back.	1
Jane	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
an	1
old	1
maid	1
soon,	1
I	1
declare.	1
She	1
is	1
almost	1
three-and-twenty!	1
Lord,	1
how	1
ashamed	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
of	1
not	1
being	1
married	1
before	1
three-and-twenty!	1
My	1
aunt	1
Phillips	1
wants	1
you	1
so	1
to	1
get	1
husbands,	1
you	1
can't	1
think.	1
She	1
says	1
Lizzy	1
had	1
better	1
have	1
taken	1
Mr.	1
Collins;	1
but	1
_I_	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
any	1
fun	1
in	1
it.	1
Lord!	1
how	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
before	1
any	1
of	1
you;	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
would	1
chaperon	1
you	1
about	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
balls.	1
Dear	1
me!	1
we	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
piece	1
of	1
fun	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
at	1
Colonel	1
Forster's.	1
Kitty	1
and	1
me	1
were	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
day	1
there,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Forster	1
promised	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
dance	1
in	1
the	1
evening;	1
(by	1
the	1
bye,	1
Mrs.	1
Forster	1
and	1
me	1
are	1
_such_	1
friends!)	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
asked	1
the	1
two	1
Harringtons	1
to	1
come,	1
but	1
Harriet	1
was	1
ill,	1
and	1
so	1
Pen	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
come	1
by	1
herself;	1
and	1
then,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
we	1
did?	1
We	1
dressed	1
up	1
Chamberlayne	1
in	1
woman's	1
clothes	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
pass	1
for	1
a	1
lady,	1
only	1
think	1
what	1
fun!	1
Not	1
a	1
soul	1
knew	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
Colonel	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Forster,	1
and	1
Kitty	1
and	1
me,	1
except	1
my	1
aunt,	1
for	1
we	1
were	1
forced	1
to	1
borrow	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
gowns;	1
and	1
you	1
cannot	1
imagine	1
how	1
well	1
he	1
looked!	1
When	1
Denny,	1
and	1
Wickham,	1
and	1
Pratt,	1
and	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
came	1
in,	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
least.	1
Lord!	1
how	1
I	1
laughed!	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
Mrs.	1
Forster.	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
died.	1
And	1
_that_	1
made	1
the	1
men	1
suspect	1
something,	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
soon	1
found	1
out	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter."	1
With	1
such	1
kinds	1
of	1
histories	1
of	1
their	1
parties	1
and	1
good	1
jokes,	1
did	1
Lydia,	1
assisted	1
by	1
Kitty's	1
hints	1
and	1
additions,	1
endeavour	1
to	1
amuse	1
her	1
companions	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Longbourn.	1
Elizabeth	1
listened	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
escaping	1
the	1
frequent	1
mention	1
of	1
Wickham's	1
name.	1
Their	1
reception	1
at	1
home	1
was	1
most	1
kind.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
see	1
Jane	1
in	1
undiminished	1
beauty;	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
during	1
dinner	1
did	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
say	1
voluntarily	1
to	1
Elizabeth:	1
"I	1
am	1
glad	1
you	1
are	1
come	1
back,	1
Lizzy."	1
Their	1
party	1
in	1
the	1
dining-room	1
was	1
large,	1
for	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
Lucases	1
came	1
to	1
meet	1
Maria	1
and	1
hear	1
the	1
news;	1
and	1
various	1
were	1
the	1
subjects	1
that	1
occupied	1
them:	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
was	1
inquiring	1
of	1
Maria,	1
after	1
the	1
welfare	1
and	1
poultry	1
of	1
her	1
eldest	1
daughter;	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
doubly	1
engaged,	1
on	1
one	1
hand	1
collecting	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
fashions	1
from	1
Jane,	1
who	1
sat	1
some	1
way	1
below	1
her,	1
and,	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
retailing	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
younger	1
Lucases;	1
and	1
Lydia,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
rather	1
louder	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
person's,	1
was	1
enumerating	1
the	1
various	1
pleasures	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
to	1
anybody	1
who	1
would	1
hear	1
her.	1
"Oh!	1
Mary,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"I	1
wish	1
you	1
had	1
gone	1
with	1
us,	1
for	1
we	1
had	1
such	1
fun!	1
As	1
we	1
went	1
along,	1
Kitty	1
and	1
I	1
drew	1
up	1
the	1
blinds,	1
and	1
pretended	1
there	1
was	1
nobody	1
in	1
the	1
coach;	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
gone	1
so	1
all	1
the	1
way,	1
if	1
Kitty	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
sick;	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
George,	1
I	1
do	1
think	1
we	1
behaved	1
very	1
handsomely,	1
for	1
we	1
treated	1
the	1
other	1
three	1
with	1
the	1
nicest	1
cold	1
luncheon	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
gone,	1
we	1
would	1
have	1
treated	1
you	1
too.	1
And	1
then	1
when	1
we	1
came	1
away	1
it	1
was	1
such	1
fun!	1
I	1
thought	1
we	1
never	1
should	1
have	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
coach.	1
I	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
die	1
of	1
laughter.	1
And	1
then	1
we	1
were	1
so	1
merry	1
all	1
the	1
way	1
home!	1
we	1
talked	1
and	1
laughed	1
so	1
loud,	1
that	1
anybody	1
might	1
have	1
heard	1
us	1
ten	1
miles	1
off!"	1
To	1
this	1
Mary	1
very	1
gravely	1
replied,	1
"Far	1
be	1
it	1
from	1
me,	1
my	1
dear	1
sister,	1
to	1
depreciate	1
such	1
pleasures!	1
They	1
would	1
doubtless	1
be	1
congenial	1
with	1
the	1
generality	1
of	1
female	1
minds.	1
But	1
I	1
confess	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
no	1
charms	1
for	1
_me_--I	1
should	1
infinitely	1
prefer	1
a	1
book."	1
But	1
of	1
this	1
answer	1
Lydia	1
heard	1
not	1
a	1
word.	1
She	1
seldom	1
listened	1
to	1
anybody	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
minute,	1
and	1
never	1
attended	1
to	1
Mary	1
at	1
all.	1
In	1
the	1
afternoon	1
Lydia	1
was	1
urgent	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
girls	1
to	1
walk	1
to	1
Meryton,	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
everybody	1
went	1
on;	1
but	1
Elizabeth	1
steadily	1
opposed	1
the	1
scheme.	1
It	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
Miss	1
Bennets	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
home	1
half	1
a	1
day	1
before	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
the	1
officers.	1
There	1
was	1
another	1
reason	1
too	1
for	1
her	1
opposition.	1
She	1
dreaded	1
seeing	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
again,	1
and	1
was	1
resolved	1
to	1
avoid	1
it	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
possible.	1
The	1
comfort	1
to	1
_her_	1
of	1
the	1
regiment's	1
approaching	1
removal	1
was	1
indeed	1
beyond	1
expression.	1
In	1
a	1
fortnight	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
go--and	1
once	1
gone,	1
she	1
hoped	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
plague	1
her	1
on	1
his	1
account.	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
many	1
hours	1
at	1
home	1
before	1
she	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
Brighton	1
scheme,	1
of	1
which	1
Lydia	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
a	1
hint	1
at	1
the	1
inn,	1
was	1
under	1
frequent	1
discussion	1
between	1
her	1
parents.	1
Elizabeth	1
saw	1
directly	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
intention	1
of	1
yielding;	1
but	1
his	1
answers	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
so	1
vague	1
and	1
equivocal,	1
that	1
her	1
mother,	1
though	1
often	1
disheartened,	1
had	1
never	1
yet	1
despaired	1
of	1
succeeding	1
at	1
last.	1
Chapter	1
40	1
Elizabeth's	1
impatience	1
to	1
acquaint	1
Jane	1
with	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
be	1
overcome;	1
and	1
at	1
length,	1
resolving	1
to	1
suppress	1
every	1
particular	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
sister	1
was	1
concerned,	1
and	1
preparing	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
surprised,	1
she	1
related	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
the	1
scene	1
between	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
and	1
herself.	1
Miss	1
Bennet's	1
astonishment	1
was	1
soon	1
lessened	1
by	1
the	1
strong	1
sisterly	1
partiality	1
which	1
made	1
any	1
admiration	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
appear	1
perfectly	1
natural;	1
and	1
all	1
surprise	1
was	1
shortly	1
lost	1
in	1
other	1
feelings.	1
She	1
was	1
sorry	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
should	1
have	1
delivered	1
his	1
sentiments	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
so	1
little	1
suited	1
to	1
recommend	1
them;	1
but	1
still	1
more	1
was	1
she	1
grieved	1
for	1
the	1
unhappiness	1
which	1
her	1
sister's	1
refusal	1
must	1
have	1
given	1
him.	1
"His	1
being	1
so	1
sure	1
of	1
succeeding	1
was	1
wrong,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"and	1
certainly	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
appeared;	1
but	1
consider	1
how	1
much	1
it	1
must	1
increase	1
his	1
disappointment!"	1
"Indeed,"	1
replied	1
Elizabeth,	1
"I	1
am	1
heartily	1
sorry	1
for	1
him;	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
other	1
feelings,	1
which	1
will	1
probably	1
soon	1
drive	1
away	1
his	1
regard	1
for	1
me.	1
You	1
do	1
not	1
blame	1
me,	1
however,	1
for	1
refusing	1
him?"	1
"Blame	1
you!	1
Oh,	1
no."	1
"But	1
you	1
blame	1
me	1
for	1
having	1
spoken	1
so	1
warmly	1
of	1
Wickham?"	1
"No--I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
wrong	1
in	1
saying	1
what	1
you	1
did."	1
"But	1
you	1
_will_	1
know	1
it,	1
when	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
happened	1
the	1
very	1
next	1
day."	1
She	1
then	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
letter,	1
repeating	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
its	1
contents	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
they	1
concerned	1
George	1
Wickham.	1
What	1
a	1
stroke	1
was	1
this	1
for	1
poor	1
Jane!	1
who	1
would	1
willingly	1
have	1
gone	1
through	1
the	1
world	1
without	1
believing	1
that	1
so	1
much	1
wickedness	1
existed	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
race	1
of	1
mankind,	1
as	1
was	1
here	1
collected	1
in	1
one	1
individual.	1
Nor	1
was	1
Darcy's	1
vindication,	1
though	1
grateful	1
to	1
her	1
feelings,	1
capable	1
of	1
consoling	1
her	1
for	1
such	1
discovery.	1
Most	1
earnestly	1
did	1
she	1
labour	1
to	1
prove	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
error,	1
and	1
seek	1
to	1
clear	1
the	1
one	1
without	1
involving	1
the	1
other.	1
"This	1
will	1
not	1
do,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth;	1
"you	1
never	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
good	1
for	1
anything.	1
Take	1
your	1
choice,	1
but	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
only	1
one.	1
There	1
is	1
but	1
such	1
a	1
quantity	1
of	1
merit	1
between	1
them;	1
just	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
good	1
sort	1
of	1
man;	1
and	1
of	1
late	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
shifting	1
about	1
pretty	1
much.	1
For	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
believe	1
it	1
all	1
Darcy's;	1
but	1
you	1
shall	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
choose."	1
It	1
was	1
some	1
time,	1
however,	1
before	1
a	1
smile	1
could	1
be	1
extorted	1
from	1
Jane.	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
shocked,"	1
said	1
she.	1
"Wickham	1
so	1
very	1
bad!	1
It	1
is	1
almost	1
past	1
belief.	1
And	1
poor	1
Mr.	1
Darcy!	1
Dear	1
Lizzy,	1
only	1
consider	1
what	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
suffered.	1
Such	1
a	1
disappointment!	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
your	1
ill	1
opinion,	1
too!	1
and	1
having	1
to	1
relate	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
his	1
sister!	1
It	1
is	1
really	1
too	1
distressing.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
must	1
feel	1
it	1
so."	1
"Oh!	1
no,	1
my	1
regret	1
and	1
compassion	1
are	1
all	1
done	1
away	1
by	1
seeing	1
you	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
both.	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
will	1
do	1
him	1
such	1
ample	1
justice,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
growing	1
every	1
moment	1
more	1
unconcerned	1
and	1
indifferent.	1
Your	1
profusion	1
makes	1
me	1
saving;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
lament	1
over	1
him	1
much	1
longer,	1
my	1
heart	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
light	1
as	1
a	1
feather."	1
"Poor	1
Wickham!	1
there	1
is	1
such	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
goodness	1
in	1
his	1
countenance!	1
such	1
an	1
openness	1
and	1
gentleness	1
in	1
his	1
manner!"	1
"There	1
certainly	1
was	1
some	1
great	1
mismanagement	1
in	1
the	1
education	1
of	1
those	1
two	1
young	1
men.	1
One	1
has	1
got	1
all	1
the	1
goodness,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
all	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
it."	1
"I	1
never	1
thought	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
so	1
deficient	1
in	1
the	1
_appearance_	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
do."	1
"And	1
yet	1
I	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
uncommonly	1
clever	1
in	1
taking	1
so	1
decided	1
a	1
dislike	1
to	1
him,	1
without	1
any	1
reason.	1
It	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
spur	1
to	1
one's	1
genius,	1
such	1
an	1
opening	1
for	1
wit,	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
dislike	1
of	1
that	1
kind.	1
One	1
may	1
be	1
continually	1
abusive	1
without	1
saying	1
anything	1
just;	1
but	1
one	1
cannot	1
always	1
be	1
laughing	1
at	1
a	1
man	1
without	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
stumbling	1
on	1
something	1
witty."	1
"Lizzy,	1
when	1
you	1
first	1
read	1
that	1
letter,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
treat	1
the	1
matter	1
as	1
you	1
do	1
now."	1
"Indeed,	1
I	1
could	1
not.	1
I	1
was	1
uncomfortable	1
enough,	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
unhappy.	1
And	1
with	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
about	1
what	1
I	1
felt,	1
no	1
Jane	1
to	1
comfort	1
me	1
and	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
very	1
weak	1
and	1
vain	1
and	1
nonsensical	1
as	1
I	1
knew	1
I	1
had!	1
Oh!	1
how	1
I	1
wanted	1
you!"	1
"How	1
unfortunate	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
used	1
such	1
very	1
strong	1
expressions	1
in	1
speaking	1
of	1
Wickham	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
for	1
now	1
they	1
_do_	1
appear	1
wholly	1
undeserved."	1
"Certainly.	1
But	1
the	1
misfortune	1
of	1
speaking	1
with	1
bitterness	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
natural	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
prejudices	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
encouraging.	1
There	1
is	1
one	1
point	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
want	1
your	1
advice.	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
whether	1
I	1
ought,	1
or	1
ought	1
not,	1
to	1
make	1
our	1
acquaintances	1
in	1
general	1
understand	1
Wickham's	1
character."	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
paused	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
then	1
replied,	1
"Surely	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
exposing	1
him	1
so	1
dreadfully.	1
What	1
is	1
your	1
opinion?"	1
"That	1
it	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
attempted.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
has	1
not	1
authorised	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
communication	1
public.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
every	1
particular	1
relative	1
to	1
his	1
sister	1
was	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible	1
to	1
myself;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
endeavour	1
to	1
undeceive	1
people	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
conduct,	1
who	1
will	1
believe	1
me?	1
The	1
general	1
prejudice	1
against	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
is	1
so	1
violent,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
half	1
the	1
good	1
people	1
in	1
Meryton	1
to	1
attempt	1
to	1
place	1
him	1
in	1
an	1
amiable	1
light.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
equal	1
to	1
it.	1
Wickham	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
gone;	1
and	1
therefore	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
signify	1
to	1
anyone	1
here	1
what	1
he	1
really	1
is.	1
Some	1
time	1
hence	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
found	1
out,	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
may	1
laugh	1
at	1
their	1
stupidity	1
in	1
not	1
knowing	1
it	1
before.	1
At	1
present	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
nothing	1
about	1
it."	1
"You	1
are	1
quite	1
right.	1
To	1
have	1
his	1
errors	1
made	1
public	1
might	1
ruin	1
him	1
for	1
ever.	1
He	1
is	1
now,	1
perhaps,	1
sorry	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
done,	1
and	1
anxious	1
to	1
re-establish	1
a	1
character.	1
We	1
must	1
not	1
make	1
him	1
desperate."	1
The	1
tumult	1
of	1
Elizabeth's	1
mind	1
was	1
allayed	1
by	1
this	1
conversation.	1
She	1
had	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
secrets	1
which	1
had	1
weighed	1
on	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
fortnight,	1
and	1
was	1
certain	1
of	1
a	1
willing	1
listener	1
in	1
Jane,	1
whenever	1
she	1
might	1
wish	1
to	1
talk	1
again	1
of	1
either.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
something	1
lurking	1
behind,	1
of	1
which	1
prudence	1
forbade	1
the	1
disclosure.	1
She	1
dared	1
not	1
relate	1
the	1
other	1
half	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
letter,	1
nor	1
explain	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
how	1
sincerely	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
valued	1
by	1
her	1
friend.	1
Here	1
was	1
knowledge	1
in	1
which	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
partake;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
sensible	1
that	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
perfect	1
understanding	1
between	1
the	1
parties	1
could	1
justify	1
her	1
in	1
throwing	1
off	1
this	1
last	1
encumbrance	1
of	1
mystery.	1
"And	1
then,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"if	1
that	1
very	1
improbable	1
event	1
should	1
ever	1
take	1
place,	1
I	1
shall	1
merely	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
tell	1
what	1
Bingley	1
may	1
tell	1
in	1
a	1
much	1
more	1
agreeable	1
manner	1
himself.	1
The	1
liberty	1
of	1
communication	1
cannot	1
be	1
mine	1
till	1
it	1
has	1
lost	1
all	1
its	1
value!"	1
She	1
was	1
now,	1
on	1
being	1
settled	1
at	1
home,	1
at	1
leisure	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
real	1
state	1
of	1
her	1
sister's	1
spirits.	1
Jane	1
was	1
not	1
happy.	1
She	1
still	1
cherished	1
a	1
very	1
tender	1
affection	1
for	1
Bingley.	1
Having	1
never	1
even	1
fancied	1
herself	1
in	1
love	1
before,	1
her	1
regard	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
warmth	1
of	1
first	1
attachment,	1
and,	1
from	1
her	1
age	1
and	1
disposition,	1
greater	1
steadiness	1
than	1
most	1
first	1
attachments	1
often	1
boast;	1
and	1
so	1
fervently	1
did	1
she	1
value	1
his	1
remembrance,	1
and	1
prefer	1
him	1
to	1
every	1
other	1
man,	1
that	1
all	1
her	1
good	1
sense,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
her	1
friends,	1
were	1
requisite	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
indulgence	1
of	1
those	1
regrets	1
which	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
injurious	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
health	1
and	1
their	1
tranquillity.	1
"Well,	1
Lizzy,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
one	1
day,	1
"what	1
is	1
your	1
opinion	1
_now_	1
of	1
this	1
sad	1
business	1
of	1
Jane's?	1
For	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
am	1
determined	1
never	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it	1
again	1
to	1
anybody.	1
I	1
told	1
my	1
sister	1
Phillips	1
so	1
the	1
other	1
day.	1
But	1
I	1
cannot	1
find	1
out	1
that	1
Jane	1
saw	1
anything	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
London.	1
Well,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
undeserving	1
young	1
man--and	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
suppose	1
there's	1
the	1
least	1
chance	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
her	1
ever	1
getting	1
him	1
now.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
talk	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
to	1
Netherfield	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
summer;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
inquired	1
of	1
everybody,	1
too,	1
who	1
is	1
likely	1
to	1
know."	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
he	1
will	1
ever	1
live	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
any	1
more."	1
"Oh	1
well!	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
chooses.	1
Nobody	1
wants	1
him	1
to	1
come.	1
Though	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
say	1
he	1
used	1
my	1
daughter	1
extremely	1
ill;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
was	1
her,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
it.	1
Well,	1
my	1
comfort	1
is,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
Jane	1
will	1
die	1
of	1
a	1
broken	1
heart;	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
sorry	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
done."	1
But	1
as	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
receive	1
comfort	1
from	1
any	1
such	1
expectation,	1
she	1
made	1
no	1
answer.	1
"Well,	1
Lizzy,"	1
continued	1
her	1
mother,	1
soon	1
afterwards,	1
"and	1
so	1
the	1
Collinses	1
live	1
very	1
comfortable,	1
do	1
they?	1
Well,	1
well,	1
I	1
only	1
hope	1
it	1
will	1
last.	1
And	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
table	1
do	1
they	1
keep?	1
Charlotte	1
is	1
an	1
excellent	1
manager,	1
I	1
dare	1
say.	1
If	1
she	1
is	1
half	1
as	1
sharp	1
as	1
her	1
mother,	1
she	1
is	1
saving	1
enough.	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
extravagant	1
in	1
_their_	1
housekeeping,	1
I	1
dare	1
say."	1
"No,	1
nothing	1
at	1
all."	1
"A	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
good	1
management,	1
depend	1
upon	1
it.	1
Yes,	1
yes.	1
_they_	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
not	1
to	1
outrun	1
their	1
income.	1
_They_	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
distressed	1
for	1
money.	1
Well,	1
much	1
good	1
may	1
it	1
do	1
them!	1
And	1
so,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
they	1
often	1
talk	1
of	1
having	1
Longbourn	1
when	1
your	1
father	1
is	1
dead.	1
They	1
look	1
upon	1
it	1
as	1
quite	1
their	1
own,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
whenever	1
that	1
happens."	1
"It	1
was	1
a	1
subject	1
which	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
mention	1
before	1
me."	1
"No;	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
strange	1
if	1
they	1
had;	1
but	1
I	1
make	1
no	1
doubt	1
they	1
often	1
talk	1
of	1
it	1
between	1
themselves.	1
Well,	1
if	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
easy	1
with	1
an	1
estate	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
lawfully	1
their	1
own,	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better.	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
having	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
only	1
entailed	1
on	1
me."	1
Chapter	1
41	1
The	1
first	1
week	1
of	1
their	1
return	1
was	1
soon	1
gone.	1
The	1
second	1
began.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
last	1
of	1
the	1
regiment's	1
stay	1
in	1
Meryton,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
young	1
ladies	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
were	1
drooping	1
apace.	1
The	1
dejection	1
was	1
almost	1
universal.	1
The	1
elder	1
Miss	1
Bennets	1
alone	1
were	1
still	1
able	1
to	1
eat,	1
drink,	1
and	1
sleep,	1
and	1
pursue	1
the	1
usual	1
course	1
of	1
their	1
employments.	1
Very	1
frequently	1
were	1
they	1
reproached	1
for	1
this	1
insensibility	1
by	1
Kitty	1
and	1
Lydia,	1
whose	1
own	1
misery	1
was	1
extreme,	1
and	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
comprehend	1
such	1
hard-heartedness	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
family.	1
"Good	1
Heaven!	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
become	1
of	1
us?	1
What	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
do?"	1
would	1
they	1
often	1
exclaim	1
in	1
the	1
bitterness	1
of	1
woe.	1
"How	1
can	1
you	1
be	1
smiling	1
so,	1
Lizzy?"	1
Their	1
affectionate	1
mother	1
shared	1
all	1
their	1
grief;	1
she	1
remembered	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
herself	1
endured	1
on	1
a	1
similar	1
occasion,	1
five-and-twenty	1
years	1
ago.	1
"I	1
am	1
sure,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"I	1
cried	1
for	1
two	1
days	1
together	1
when	1
Colonel	1
Miller's	1
regiment	1
went	1
away.	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
broken	1
my	1
heart."	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
shall	1
break	1
_mine_,"	1
said	1
Lydia.	1
"If	1
one	1
could	1
but	1
go	1
to	1
Brighton!"	1
observed	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet.	1
"Oh,	1
yes!--if	1
one	1
could	1
but	1
go	1
to	1
Brighton!	1
But	1
papa	1
is	1
so	1
disagreeable."	1
"A	1
little	1
sea-bathing	1
would	1
set	1
me	1
up	1
forever."	1
"And	1
my	1
aunt	1
Phillips	1
is	1
sure	1
it	1
would	1
do	1
_me_	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
good,"	1
added	1
Kitty.	1
Such	1
were	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
lamentations	1
resounding	1
perpetually	1
through	1
Longbourn	1
House.	1
Elizabeth	1
tried	1
to	1
be	1
diverted	1
by	1
them;	1
but	1
all	1
sense	1
of	1
pleasure	1
was	1
lost	1
in	1
shame.	1
She	1
felt	1
anew	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
objections;	1
and	1
never	1
had	1
she	1
been	1
so	1
much	1
disposed	1
to	1
pardon	1
his	1
interference	1
in	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
his	1
friend.	1
But	1
the	1
gloom	1
of	1
Lydia's	1
prospect	1
was	1
shortly	1
cleared	1
away;	1
for	1
she	1
received	1
an	1
invitation	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Forster,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
colonel	1
of	1
the	1
regiment,	1
to	1
accompany	1
her	1
to	1
Brighton.	1
This	1
invaluable	1
friend	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
young	1
woman,	1
and	1
very	1
lately	1
married.	1
A	1
resemblance	1
in	1
good	1
humour	1
and	1
good	1
spirits	1
had	1
recommended	1
her	1
and	1
Lydia	1
to	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
_three_	1
months'	1
acquaintance	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
intimate	1
_two_.	1
The	1
rapture	1
of	1
Lydia	1
on	1
this	1
occasion,	1
her	1
adoration	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Forster,	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
and	1
the	1
mortification	1
of	1
Kitty,	1
are	1
scarcely	1
to	1
be	1
described.	1
Wholly	1
inattentive	1
to	1
her	1
sister's	1
feelings,	1
Lydia	1
flew	1
about	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
restless	1
ecstasy,	1
calling	1
for	1
everyone's	1
congratulations,	1
and	1
laughing	1
and	1
talking	1
with	1
more	1
violence	1
than	1
ever;	1
whilst	1
the	1
luckless	1
Kitty	1
continued	1
in	1
the	1
parlour	1
repined	1
at	1
her	1
fate	1
in	1
terms	1
as	1
unreasonable	1
as	1
her	1
accent	1
was	1
peevish.	1
"I	1
cannot	1
see	1
why	1
Mrs.	1
Forster	1
should	1
not	1
ask	1
_me_	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Lydia,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"Though	1
I	1
am	1
_not_	1
her	1
particular	1
friend.	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
asked	1
as	1
she	1
has,	1
and	1
more	1
too,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
two	1
years	1
older."	1
In	1
vain	1
did	1
Elizabeth	1
attempt	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
reasonable,	1
and	1
Jane	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
resigned.	1
As	1
for	1
Elizabeth	1
herself,	1
this	1
invitation	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
exciting	1
in	1
her	1
the	1
same	1
feelings	1
as	1
in	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
Lydia,	1
that	1
she	1
considered	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
death	1
warrant	1
of	1
all	1
possibility	1
of	1
common	1
sense	1
for	1
the	1
latter;	1
and	1
detestable	1
as	1
such	1
a	1
step	1
must	1
make	1
her	1
were	1
it	1
known,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
secretly	1
advising	1
her	1
father	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
go.	1
She	1
represented	1
to	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
improprieties	1
of	1
Lydia's	1
general	1
behaviour,	1
the	1
little	1
advantage	1
she	1
could	1
derive	1
from	1
the	1
friendship	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
woman	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Forster,	1
and	1
the	1
probability	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
yet	1
more	1
imprudent	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
companion	1
at	1
Brighton,	1
where	1
the	1
temptations	1
must	1
be	1
greater	1
than	1
at	1
home.	1
He	1
heard	1
her	1
attentively,	1
and	1
then	1
said:	1
"Lydia	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
easy	1
until	1
she	1
has	1
exposed	1
herself	1
in	1
some	1
public	1
place	1
or	1
other,	1
and	1
we	1
can	1
never	1
expect	1
her	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
with	1
so	1
little	1
expense	1
or	1
inconvenience	1
to	1
her	1
family	1
as	1
under	1
the	1
present	1
circumstances."	1
"If	1
you	1
were	1
aware,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
"of	1
the	1
very	1
great	1
disadvantage	1
to	1
us	1
all	1
which	1
must	1
arise	1
from	1
the	1
public	1
notice	1
of	1
Lydia's	1
unguarded	1
and	1
imprudent	1
manner--nay,	1
which	1
has	1
already	1
arisen	1
from	1
it,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
would	1
judge	1
differently	1
in	1
the	1
affair."	1
"Already	1
arisen?"	1
repeated	1
Mr.	1
Bennet.	1
"What,	1
has	1
she	1
frightened	1
away	1
some	1
of	1
your	1
lovers?	1
Poor	1
little	1
Lizzy!	1
But	1
do	1
not	1
be	1
cast	1
down.	1
Such	1
squeamish	1
youths	1
as	1
cannot	1
bear	1
to	1
be	1
connected	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
absurdity	1
are	1
not	1
worth	1
a	1
regret.	1
Come,	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
pitiful	1
fellows	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
kept	1
aloof	1
by	1
Lydia's	1
folly."	1
"Indeed	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
such	1
injuries	1
to	1
resent.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
particular,	1
but	1
of	1
general	1
evils,	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
complaining.	1
Our	1
importance,	1
our	1
respectability	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
must	1
be	1
affected	1
by	1
the	1
wild	1
volatility,	1
the	1
assurance	1
and	1
disdain	1
of	1
all	1
restraint	1
which	1
mark	1
Lydia's	1
character.	1
Excuse	1
me,	1
for	1
I	1
must	1
speak	1
plainly.	1
If	1
you,	1
my	1
dear	1
father,	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
checking	1
her	1
exuberant	1
spirits,	1
and	1
of	1
teaching	1
her	1
that	1
her	1
present	1
pursuits	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
her	1
life,	1
she	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
beyond	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
amendment.	1
Her	1
character	1
will	1
be	1
fixed,	1
and	1
she	1
will,	1
at	1
sixteen,	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
determined	1
flirt	1
that	1
ever	1
made	1
herself	1
or	1
her	1
family	1
ridiculous;	1
a	1
flirt,	1
too,	1
in	1
the	1
worst	1
and	1
meanest	1
degree	1
of	1
flirtation;	1
without	1
any	1
attraction	1
beyond	1
youth	1
and	1
a	1
tolerable	1
person;	1
and,	1
from	1
the	1
ignorance	1
and	1
emptiness	1
of	1
her	1
mind,	1
wholly	1
unable	1
to	1
ward	1
off	1
any	1
portion	1
of	1
that	1
universal	1
contempt	1
which	1
her	1
rage	1
for	1
admiration	1
will	1
excite.	1
In	1
this	1
danger	1
Kitty	1
also	1
is	1
comprehended.	1
She	1
will	1
follow	1
wherever	1
Lydia	1
leads.	1
Vain,	1
ignorant,	1
idle,	1
and	1
absolutely	1
uncontrolled!	1
Oh!	1
my	1
dear	1
father,	1
can	1
you	1
suppose	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
censured	1
and	1
despised	1
wherever	1
they	1
are	1
known,	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
sisters	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
often	1
involved	1
in	1
the	1
disgrace?"	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
whole	1
heart	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
subject,	1
and	1
affectionately	1
taking	1
her	1
hand	1
said	1
in	1
reply:	1
"Do	1
not	1
make	1
yourself	1
uneasy,	1
my	1
love.	1
Wherever	1
you	1
and	1
Jane	1
are	1
known	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
respected	1
and	1
valued;	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
less	1
advantage	1
for	1
having	1
a	1
couple	1
of--or	1
I	1
may	1
say,	1
three--very	1
silly	1
sisters.	1
We	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
peace	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
if	1
Lydia	1
does	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
Brighton.	1
Let	1
her	1
go,	1
then.	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
is	1
a	1
sensible	1
man,	1
and	1
will	1
keep	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
any	1
real	1
mischief;	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
luckily	1
too	1
poor	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
prey	1
to	1
anybody.	1
At	1
Brighton	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
less	1
importance	1
even	1
as	1
a	1
common	1
flirt	1
than	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
here.	1
The	1
officers	1
will	1
find	1
women	1
better	1
worth	1
their	1
notice.	1
Let	1
us	1
hope,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
her	1
being	1
there	1
may	1
teach	1
her	1
her	1
own	1
insignificance.	1
At	1
any	1
rate,	1
she	1
cannot	1
grow	1
many	1
degrees	1
worse,	1
without	1
authorising	1
us	1
to	1
lock	1
her	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
her	1
life."	1
With	1
this	1
answer	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
be	1
content;	1
but	1
her	1
own	1
opinion	1
continued	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
she	1
left	1
him	1
disappointed	1
and	1
sorry.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
her	1
nature,	1
however,	1
to	1
increase	1
her	1
vexations	1
by	1
dwelling	1
on	1
them.	1
She	1
was	1
confident	1
of	1
having	1
performed	1
her	1
duty,	1
and	1
to	1
fret	1
over	1
unavoidable	1
evils,	1
or	1
augment	1
them	1
by	1
anxiety,	1
was	1
no	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
disposition.	1
Had	1
Lydia	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
known	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
her	1
conference	1
with	1
her	1
father,	1
their	1
indignation	1
would	1
hardly	1
have	1
found	1
expression	1
in	1
their	1
united	1
volubility.	1
In	1
Lydia's	1
imagination,	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
Brighton	1
comprised	1
every	1
possibility	1
of	1
earthly	1
happiness.	1
She	1
saw,	1
with	1
the	1
creative	1
eye	1
of	1
fancy,	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
that	1
gay	1
bathing-place	1
covered	1
with	1
officers.	1
She	1
saw	1
herself	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
attention,	1
to	1
tens	1
and	1
to	1
scores	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
present	1
unknown.	1
She	1
saw	1
all	1
the	1
glories	1
of	1
the	1
camp--its	1
tents	1
stretched	1
forth	1
in	1
beauteous	1
uniformity	1
of	1
lines,	1
crowded	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
and	1
the	1
gay,	1
and	1
dazzling	1
with	1
scarlet;	1
and,	1
to	1
complete	1
the	1
view,	1
she	1
saw	1
herself	1
seated	1
beneath	1
a	1
tent,	1
tenderly	1
flirting	1
with	1
at	1
least	1
six	1
officers	1
at	1
once.	1
Had	1
she	1
known	1
her	1
sister	1
sought	1
to	1
tear	1
her	1
from	1
such	1
prospects	1
and	1
such	1
realities	1
as	1
these,	1
what	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
her	1
sensations?	1
They	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
understood	1
only	1
by	1
her	1
mother,	1
who	1
might	1
have	1
felt	1
nearly	1
the	1
same.	1
Lydia's	1
going	1
to	1
Brighton	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
consoled	1
her	1
for	1
her	1
melancholy	1
conviction	1
of	1
her	1
husband's	1
never	1
intending	1
to	1
go	1
there	1
himself.	1
But	1
they	1
were	1
entirely	1
ignorant	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
passed;	1
and	1
their	1
raptures	1
continued,	1
with	1
little	1
intermission,	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
of	1
Lydia's	1
leaving	1
home.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
now	1
to	1
see	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time.	1
Having	1
been	1
frequently	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
him	1
since	1
her	1
return,	1
agitation	1
was	1
pretty	1
well	1
over;	1
the	1
agitations	1
of	1
formal	1
partiality	1
entirely	1
so.	1
She	1
had	1
even	1
learnt	1
to	1
detect,	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
gentleness	1
which	1
had	1
first	1
delighted	1
her,	1
an	1
affectation	1
and	1
a	1
sameness	1
to	1
disgust	1
and	1
weary.	1
In	1
his	1
present	1
behaviour	1
to	1
herself,	1
moreover,	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
fresh	1
source	1
of	1
displeasure,	1
for	1
the	1
inclination	1
he	1
soon	1
testified	1
of	1
renewing	1
those	1
intentions	1
which	1
had	1
marked	1
the	1
early	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
acquaintance	1
could	1
only	1
serve,	1
after	1
what	1
had	1
since	1
passed,	1
to	1
provoke	1
her.	1
She	1
lost	1
all	1
concern	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
finding	1
herself	1
thus	1
selected	1
as	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
such	1
idle	1
and	1
frivolous	1
gallantry;	1
and	1
while	1
she	1
steadily	1
repressed	1
it,	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
feel	1
the	1
reproof	1
contained	1
in	1
his	1
believing,	1
that	1
however	1
long,	1
and	1
for	1
whatever	1
cause,	1
his	1
attentions	1
had	1
been	1
withdrawn,	1
her	1
vanity	1
would	1
be	1
gratified,	1
and	1
her	1
preference	1
secured	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
by	1
their	1
renewal.	1
On	1
the	1
very	1
last	1
day	1
of	1
the	1
regiment's	1
remaining	1
at	1
Meryton,	1
he	1
dined,	1
with	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
officers,	1
at	1
Longbourn;	1
and	1
so	1
little	1
was	1
Elizabeth	1
disposed	1
to	1
part	1
from	1
him	1
in	1
good	1
humour,	1
that	1
on	1
his	1
making	1
some	1
inquiry	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
time	1
had	1
passed	1
at	1
Hunsford,	1
she	1
mentioned	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam's	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
having	1
both	1
spent	1
three	1
weeks	1
at	1
Rosings,	1
and	1
asked	1
him,	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
former.	1
He	1
looked	1
surprised,	1
displeased,	1
alarmed;	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
moment's	1
recollection	1
and	1
a	1
returning	1
smile,	1
replied,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
formerly	1
seen	1
him	1
often;	1
and,	1
after	1
observing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
gentlemanlike	1
man,	1
asked	1
her	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
liked	1
him.	1
Her	1
answer	1
was	1
warmly	1
in	1
his	1
favour.	1
With	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
indifference	1
he	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
added:	1
"How	1
long	1
did	1
you	1
say	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
Rosings?"	1
"Nearly	1
three	1
weeks."	1
"And	1
you	1
saw	1
him	1
frequently?"	1
"Yes,	1
almost	1
every	1
day."	1
"His	1
manners	1
are	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
his	1
cousin's."	1
"Yes,	1
very	1
different.	1
But	1
I	1
think	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
improves	1
upon	1
acquaintance."	1
"Indeed!"	1
cried	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
escape	1
her.	1
"And	1
pray,	1
may	1
I	1
ask?--"	1
But	1
checking	1
himself,	1
he	1
added,	1
in	1
a	1
gayer	1
tone,	1
"Is	1
it	1
in	1
address	1
that	1
he	1
improves?	1
Has	1
he	1
deigned	1
to	1
add	1
aught	1
of	1
civility	1
to	1
his	1
ordinary	1
style?--for	1
I	1
dare	1
not	1
hope,"	1
he	1
continued	1
in	1
a	1
lower	1
and	1
more	1
serious	1
tone,	1
"that	1
he	1
is	1
improved	1
in	1
essentials."	1
"Oh,	1
no!"	1
said	1
Elizabeth.	1
"In	1
essentials,	1
I	1
believe,	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
what	1
he	1
ever	1
was."	1
While	1
she	1
spoke,	1
Wickham	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
scarcely	1
knowing	1
whether	1
to	1
rejoice	1
over	1
her	1
words,	1
or	1
to	1
distrust	1
their	1
meaning.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
something	1
in	1
her	1
countenance	1
which	1
made	1
him	1
listen	1
with	1
an	1
apprehensive	1
and	1
anxious	1
attention,	1
while	1
she	1
added:	1
"When	1
I	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
improved	1
on	1
acquaintance,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
that	1
his	1
mind	1
or	1
his	1
manners	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
improvement,	1
but	1
that,	1
from	1
knowing	1
him	1
better,	1
his	1
disposition	1
was	1
better	1
understood."	1
Wickham's	1
alarm	1
now	1
appeared	1
in	1
a	1
heightened	1
complexion	1
and	1
agitated	1
look;	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
he	1
was	1
silent,	1
till,	1
shaking	1
off	1
his	1
embarrassment,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
her	1
again,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
the	1
gentlest	1
of	1
accents:	1
"You,	1
who	1
so	1
well	1
know	1
my	1
feeling	1
towards	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
will	1
readily	1
comprehend	1
how	1
sincerely	1
I	1
must	1
rejoice	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
wise	1
enough	1
to	1
assume	1
even	1
the	1
_appearance_	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
right.	1
His	1
pride,	1
in	1
that	1
direction,	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
service,	1
if	1
not	1
to	1
himself,	1
to	1
many	1
others,	1
for	1
it	1
must	1
only	1
deter	1
him	1
from	1
such	1
foul	1
misconduct	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
suffered	1
by.	1
I	1
only	1
fear	1
that	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
cautiousness	1
to	1
which	1
you,	1
I	1
imagine,	1
have	1
been	1
alluding,	1
is	1
merely	1
adopted	1
on	1
his	1
visits	1
to	1
his	1
aunt,	1
of	1
whose	1
good	1
opinion	1
and	1
judgement	1
he	1
stands	1
much	1
in	1
awe.	1
His	1
fear	1
of	1
her	1
has	1
always	1
operated,	1
I	1
know,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
together;	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
imputed	1
to	1
his	1
wish	1
of	1
forwarding	1
the	1
match	1
with	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh,	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
certain	1
he	1
has	1
very	1
much	1
at	1
heart."	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
repress	1
a	1
smile	1
at	1
this,	1
but	1
she	1
answered	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
slight	1
inclination	1
of	1
the	1
head.	1
She	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
engage	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
old	1
subject	1
of	1
his	1
grievances,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
no	1
humour	1
to	1
indulge	1
him.	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
passed	1
with	1
the	1
_appearance_,	1
on	1
his	1
side,	1
of	1
usual	1
cheerfulness,	1
but	1
with	1
no	1
further	1
attempt	1
to	1
distinguish	1
Elizabeth;	1
and	1
they	1
parted	1
at	1
last	1
with	1
mutual	1
civility,	1
and	1
possibly	1
a	1
mutual	1
desire	1
of	1
never	1
meeting	1
again.	1
When	1
the	1
party	1
broke	1
up,	1
Lydia	1
returned	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Forster	1
to	1
Meryton,	1
from	1
whence	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
set	1
out	1
early	1
the	1
next	1
morning.	1
The	1
separation	1
between	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
family	1
was	1
rather	1
noisy	1
than	1
pathetic.	1
Kitty	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
who	1
shed	1
tears;	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
weep	1
from	1
vexation	1
and	1
envy.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
diffuse	1
in	1
her	1
good	1
wishes	1
for	1
the	1
felicity	1
of	1
her	1
daughter,	1
and	1
impressive	1
in	1
her	1
injunctions	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
miss	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
enjoying	1
herself	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible--advice	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
every	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
attended	1
to;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
clamorous	1
happiness	1
of	1
Lydia	1
herself	1
in	1
bidding	1
farewell,	1
the	1
more	1
gentle	1
adieus	1
of	1
her	1
sisters	1
were	1
uttered	1
without	1
being	1
heard.	1
Chapter	1
42	1
Had	1
Elizabeth's	1
opinion	1
been	1
all	1
drawn	1
from	1
her	1
own	1
family,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
formed	1
a	1
very	1
pleasing	1
opinion	1
of	1
conjugal	1
felicity	1
or	1
domestic	1
comfort.	1
Her	1
father,	1
captivated	1
by	1
youth	1
and	1
beauty,	1
and	1
that	1
appearance	1
of	1
good	1
humour	1
which	1
youth	1
and	1
beauty	1
generally	1
give,	1
had	1
married	1
a	1
woman	1
whose	1
weak	1
understanding	1
and	1
illiberal	1
mind	1
had	1
very	1
early	1
in	1
their	1
marriage	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
all	1
real	1
affection	1
for	1
her.	1
Respect,	1
esteem,	1
and	1
confidence	1
had	1
vanished	1
for	1
ever;	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
views	1
of	1
domestic	1
happiness	1
were	1
overthrown.	1
But	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
disposition	1
to	1
seek	1
comfort	1
for	1
the	1
disappointment	1
which	1
his	1
own	1
imprudence	1
had	1
brought	1
on,	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
pleasures	1
which	1
too	1
often	1
console	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
for	1
their	1
folly	1
or	1
their	1
vice.	1
He	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
of	1
books;	1
and	1
from	1
these	1
tastes	1
had	1
arisen	1
his	1
principal	1
enjoyments.	1
To	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
little	1
otherwise	1
indebted,	1
than	1
as	1
her	1
ignorance	1
and	1
folly	1
had	1
contributed	1
to	1
his	1
amusement.	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
happiness	1
which	1
a	1
man	1
would	1
in	1
general	1
wish	1
to	1
owe	1
to	1
his	1
wife;	1
but	1
where	1
other	1
powers	1
of	1
entertainment	1
are	1
wanting,	1
the	1
true	1
philosopher	1
will	1
derive	1
benefit	1
from	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
given.	1
Elizabeth,	1
however,	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
blind	1
to	1
the	1
impropriety	1
of	1
her	1
father's	1
behaviour	1
as	1
a	1
husband.	1
She	1
had	1
always	1
seen	1
it	1
with	1
pain;	1
but	1
respecting	1
his	1
abilities,	1
and	1
grateful	1
for	1
his	1
affectionate	1
treatment	1
of	1
herself,	1
she	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
forget	1
what	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
overlook,	1
and	1
to	1
banish	1
from	1
her	1
thoughts	1
that	1
continual	1
breach	1
of	1
conjugal	1
obligation	1
and	1
decorum	1
which,	1
in	1
exposing	1
his	1
wife	1
to	1
the	1
contempt	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
children,	1
was	1
so	1
highly	1
reprehensible.	1
But	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
felt	1
so	1
strongly	1
as	1
now	1
the	1
disadvantages	1
which	1
must	1
attend	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
so	1
unsuitable	1
a	1
marriage,	1
nor	1
ever	1
been	1
so	1
fully	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
evils	1
arising	1
from	1
so	1
ill-judged	1
a	1
direction	1
of	1
talents;	1
talents,	1
which,	1
rightly	1
used,	1
might	1
at	1
least	1
have	1
preserved	1
the	1
respectability	1
of	1
his	1
daughters,	1
even	1
if	1
incapable	1
of	1
enlarging	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
his	1
wife.	1
When	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
rejoiced	1
over	1
Wickham's	1
departure	1
she	1
found	1
little	1
other	1
cause	1
for	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
regiment.	1
Their	1
parties	1
abroad	1
were	1
less	1
varied	1
than	1
before,	1
and	1
at	1
home	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
mother	1
and	1
sister	1
whose	1
constant	1
repinings	1
at	1
the	1
dullness	1
of	1
everything	1
around	1
them	1
threw	1
a	1
real	1
gloom	1
over	1
their	1
domestic	1
circle;	1
and,	1
though	1
Kitty	1
might	1
in	1
time	1
regain	1
her	1
natural	1
degree	1
of	1
sense,	1
since	1
the	1
disturbers	1
of	1
her	1
brain	1
were	1
removed,	1
her	1
other	1
sister,	1
from	1
whose	1
disposition	1
greater	1
evil	1
might	1
be	1
apprehended,	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
hardened	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
folly	1
and	1
assurance	1
by	1
a	1
situation	1
of	1
such	1
double	1
danger	1
as	1
a	1
watering-place	1
and	1
a	1
camp.	1
Upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
therefore,	1
she	1
found,	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
sometimes	1
found	1
before,	1
that	1
an	1
event	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
looking	1
with	1
impatient	1
desire	1
did	1
not,	1
in	1
taking	1
place,	1
bring	1
all	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
she	1
had	1
promised	1
herself.	1
It	1
was	1
consequently	1
necessary	1
to	1
name	1
some	1
other	1
period	1
for	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
actual	1
felicity--to	1
have	1
some	1
other	1
point	1
on	1
which	1
her	1
wishes	1
and	1
hopes	1
might	1
be	1
fixed,	1
and	1
by	1
again	1
enjoying	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
anticipation,	1
console	1
herself	1
for	1
the	1
present,	1
and	1
prepare	1
for	1
another	1
disappointment.	1
Her	1
tour	1
to	1
the	1
Lakes	1
was	1
now	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
her	1
happiest	1
thoughts;	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
best	1
consolation	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
uncomfortable	1
hours	1
which	1
the	1
discontentedness	1
of	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
Kitty	1
made	1
inevitable;	1
and	1
could	1
she	1
have	1
included	1
Jane	1
in	1
the	1
scheme,	1
every	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
perfect.	1
"But	1
it	1
is	1
fortunate,"	1
thought	1
she,	1
"that	1
I	1
have	1
something	1
to	1
wish	1
for.	1
Were	1
the	1
whole	1
arrangement	1
complete,	1
my	1
disappointment	1
would	1
be	1
certain.	1
But	1
here,	1
by	1
carrying	1
with	1
me	1
one	1
ceaseless	1
source	1
of	1
regret	1
in	1
my	1
sister's	1
absence,	1
I	1
may	1
reasonably	1
hope	1
to	1
have	1
all	1
my	1
expectations	1
of	1
pleasure	1
realised.	1
A	1
scheme	1
of	1
which	1
every	1
part	1
promises	1
delight	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
successful;	1
and	1
general	1
disappointment	1
is	1
only	1
warded	1
off	1
by	1
the	1
defence	1
of	1
some	1
little	1
peculiar	1
vexation."	1
When	1
Lydia	1
went	1
away	1
she	1
promised	1
to	1
write	1
very	1
often	1
and	1
very	1
minutely	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
Kitty;	1
but	1
her	1
letters	1
were	1
always	1
long	1
expected,	1
and	1
always	1
very	1
short.	1
Those	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
contained	1
little	1
else	1
than	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
just	1
returned	1
from	1
the	1
library,	1
where	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
officers	1
had	1
attended	1
them,	1
and	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
such	1
beautiful	1
ornaments	1
as	1
made	1
her	1
quite	1
wild;	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
new	1
gown,	1
or	1
a	1
new	1
parasol,	1
which	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
described	1
more	1
fully,	1
but	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
leave	1
off	1
in	1
a	1
violent	1
hurry,	1
as	1
Mrs.	1
Forster	1
called	1
her,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
camp;	1
and	1
from	1
her	1
correspondence	1
with	1
her	1
sister,	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
less	1
to	1
be	1
learnt--for	1
her	1
letters	1
to	1
Kitty,	1
though	1
rather	1
longer,	1
were	1
much	1
too	1
full	1
of	1
lines	1
under	1
the	1
words	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
public.	1
After	1
the	1
first	1
fortnight	1
or	1
three	1
weeks	1
of	1
her	1
absence,	1
health,	1
good	1
humour,	1
and	1
cheerfulness	1
began	1
to	1
reappear	1
at	1
Longbourn.	1
Everything	1
wore	1
a	1
happier	1
aspect.	1
The	1
families	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
town	1
for	1
the	1
winter	1
came	1
back	1
again,	1
and	1
summer	1
finery	1
and	1
summer	1
engagements	1
arose.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
restored	1
to	1
her	1
usual	1
querulous	1
serenity;	1
and,	1
by	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
June,	1
Kitty	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
recovered	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
enter	1
Meryton	1
without	1
tears;	1
an	1
event	1
of	1
such	1
happy	1
promise	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
Elizabeth	1
hope	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
following	1
Christmas	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
so	1
tolerably	1
reasonable	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
mention	1
an	1
officer	1
above	1
once	1
a	1
day,	1
unless,	1
by	1
some	1
cruel	1
and	1
malicious	1
arrangement	1
at	1
the	1
War	1
Office,	1
another	1
regiment	1
should	1
be	1
quartered	1
in	1
Meryton.	1
The	1
time	1
fixed	1
for	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
their	1
northern	1
tour	1
was	1
now	1
fast	1
approaching,	1
and	1
a	1
fortnight	1
only	1
was	1
wanting	1
of	1
it,	1
when	1
a	1
letter	1
arrived	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
which	1
at	1
once	1
delayed	1
its	1
commencement	1
and	1
curtailed	1
its	1
extent.	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
would	1
be	1
prevented	1
by	1
business	1
from	1
setting	1
out	1
till	1
a	1
fortnight	1
later	1
in	1
July,	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
London	1
again	1
within	1
a	1
month,	1
and	1
as	1
that	1
left	1
too	1
short	1
a	1
period	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
so	1
far,	1
and	1
see	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
proposed,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
leisure	1
and	1
comfort	1
they	1
had	1
built	1
on,	1
they	1
were	1
obliged	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
Lakes,	1
and	1
substitute	1
a	1
more	1
contracted	1
tour,	1
and,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
plan,	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
no	1
farther	1
northwards	1
than	1
Derbyshire.	1
In	1
that	1
county	1
there	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
to	1
occupy	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
their	1
three	1
weeks;	1
and	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
it	1
had	1
a	1
peculiarly	1
strong	1
attraction.	1
The	1
town	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
formerly	1
passed	1
some	1
years	1
of	1
her	1
life,	1
and	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
to	1
spend	1
a	1
few	1
days,	1
was	1
probably	1
as	1
great	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
her	1
curiosity	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
celebrated	1
beauties	1
of	1
Matlock,	1
Chatsworth,	1
Dovedale,	1
or	1
the	1
Peak.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
excessively	1
disappointed;	1
she	1
had	1
set	1
her	1
heart	1
on	1
seeing	1
the	1
Lakes,	1
and	1
still	1
thought	1
there	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
time	1
enough.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
her	1
business	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied--and	1
certainly	1
her	1
temper	1
to	1
be	1
happy;	1
and	1
all	1
was	1
soon	1
right	1
again.	1
With	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
Derbyshire	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
ideas	1
connected.	1
It	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
word	1
without	1
thinking	1
of	1
Pemberley	1
and	1
its	1
owner.	1
"But	1
surely,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"I	1
may	1
enter	1
his	1
county	1
with	1
impunity,	1
and	1
rob	1
it	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
petrified	1
spars	1
without	1
his	1
perceiving	1
me."	1
The	1
period	1
of	1
expectation	1
was	1
now	1
doubled.	1
Four	1
weeks	1
were	1
to	1
pass	1
away	1
before	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt's	1
arrival.	1
But	1
they	1
did	1
pass	1
away,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
with	1
their	1
four	1
children,	1
did	1
at	1
length	1
appear	1
at	1
Longbourn.	1
The	1
children,	1
two	1
girls	1
of	1
six	1
and	1
eight	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
two	1
younger	1
boys,	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
under	1
the	1
particular	1
care	1
of	1
their	1
cousin	1
Jane,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
general	1
favourite,	1
and	1
whose	1
steady	1
sense	1
and	1
sweetness	1
of	1
temper	1
exactly	1
adapted	1
her	1
for	1
attending	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
every	1
way--teaching	1
them,	1
playing	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
loving	1
them.	1
The	1
Gardiners	1
stayed	1
only	1
one	1
night	1
at	1
Longbourn,	1
and	1
set	1
off	1
the	1
next	1
morning	1
with	1
Elizabeth	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
novelty	1
and	1
amusement.	1
One	1
enjoyment	1
was	1
certain--that	1
of	1
suitableness	1
of	1
companions;	1
a	1
suitableness	1
which	1
comprehended	1
health	1
and	1
temper	1
to	1
bear	1
inconveniences--cheerfulness	1
to	1
enhance	1
every	1
pleasure--and	1
affection	1
and	1
intelligence,	1
which	1
might	1
supply	1
it	1
among	1
themselves	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
disappointments	1
abroad.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
this	1
work	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
description	1
of	1
Derbyshire,	1
nor	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
remarkable	1
places	1
through	1
which	1
their	1
route	1
thither	1
lay;	1
Oxford,	1
Blenheim,	1
Warwick,	1
Kenilworth,	1
Birmingham,	1
etc.	1
are	1
sufficiently	1
known.	1
A	1
small	1
part	1
of	1
Derbyshire	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
present	1
concern.	1
To	1
the	1
little	1
town	1
of	1
Lambton,	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner's	1
former	1
residence,	1
and	1
where	1
she	1
had	1
lately	1
learned	1
some	1
acquaintance	1
still	1
remained,	1
they	1
bent	1
their	1
steps,	1
after	1
having	1
seen	1
all	1
the	1
principal	1
wonders	1
of	1
the	1
country;	1
and	1
within	1
five	1
miles	1
of	1
Lambton,	1
Elizabeth	1
found	1
from	1
her	1
aunt	1
that	1
Pemberley	1
was	1
situated.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
their	1
direct	1
road,	1
nor	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
mile	1
or	1
two	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
In	1
talking	1
over	1
their	1
route	1
the	1
evening	1
before,	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
expressed	1
an	1
inclination	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
place	1
again.	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
declared	1
his	1
willingness,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
applied	1
to	1
for	1
her	1
approbation.	1
"My	1
love,	1
should	1
not	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
heard	1
so	1
much?"	1
said	1
her	1
aunt;	1
"a	1
place,	1
too,	1
with	1
which	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
your	1
acquaintances	1
are	1
connected.	1
Wickham	1
passed	1
all	1
his	1
youth	1
there,	1
you	1
know."	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
distressed.	1
She	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
business	1
at	1
Pemberley,	1
and	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
assume	1
a	1
disinclination	1
for	1
seeing	1
it.	1
She	1
must	1
own	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
tired	1
of	1
seeing	1
great	1
houses;	1
after	1
going	1
over	1
so	1
many,	1
she	1
really	1
had	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
fine	1
carpets	1
or	1
satin	1
curtains.	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
abused	1
her	1
stupidity.	1
"If	1
it	1
were	1
merely	1
a	1
fine	1
house	1
richly	1
furnished,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"I	1
should	1
not	1
care	1
about	1
it	1
myself;	1
but	1
the	1
grounds	1
are	1
delightful.	1
They	1
have	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
woods	1
in	1
the	1
country."	1
Elizabeth	1
said	1
no	1
more--but	1
her	1
mind	1
could	1
not	1
acquiesce.	1
The	1
possibility	1
of	1
meeting	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
while	1
viewing	1
the	1
place,	1
instantly	1
occurred.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
dreadful!	1
She	1
blushed	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
idea,	1
and	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
speak	1
openly	1
to	1
her	1
aunt	1
than	1
to	1
run	1
such	1
a	1
risk.	1
But	1
against	1
this	1
there	1
were	1
objections;	1
and	1
she	1
finally	1
resolved	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
resource,	1
if	1
her	1
private	1
inquiries	1
to	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
were	1
unfavourably	1
answered.	1
Accordingly,	1
when	1
she	1
retired	1
at	1
night,	1
she	1
asked	1
the	1
chambermaid	1
whether	1
Pemberley	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
very	1
fine	1
place?	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
its	1
proprietor?	1
and,	1
with	1
no	1
little	1
alarm,	1
whether	1
the	1
family	1
were	1
down	1
for	1
the	1
summer?	1
A	1
most	1
welcome	1
negative	1
followed	1
the	1
last	1
question--and	1
her	1
alarms	1
now	1
being	1
removed,	1
she	1
was	1
at	1
leisure	1
to	1
feel	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
curiosity	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
house	1
herself;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
subject	1
was	1
revived	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
again	1
applied	1
to,	1
could	1
readily	1
answer,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
proper	1
air	1
of	1
indifference,	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
really	1
any	1
dislike	1
to	1
the	1
scheme.	1
To	1
Pemberley,	1
therefore,	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
go.	1
Chapter	1
43	1
Elizabeth,	1
as	1
they	1
drove	1
along,	1
watched	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
appearance	1
of	1
Pemberley	1
Woods	1
with	1
some	1
perturbation;	1
and	1
when	1
at	1
length	1
they	1
turned	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
lodge,	1
her	1
spirits	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
high	1
flutter.	1
The	1
park	1
was	1
very	1
large,	1
and	1
contained	1
great	1
variety	1
of	1
ground.	1
They	1
entered	1
it	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
lowest	1
points,	1
and	1
drove	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
through	1
a	1
beautiful	1
wood	1
stretching	1
over	1
a	1
wide	1
extent.	1
Elizabeth's	1
mind	1
was	1
too	1
full	1
for	1
conversation,	1
but	1
she	1
saw	1
and	1
admired	1
every	1
remarkable	1
spot	1
and	1
point	1
of	1
view.	1
They	1
gradually	1
ascended	1
for	1
half-a-mile,	1
and	1
then	1
found	1
themselves	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
considerable	1
eminence,	1
where	1
the	1
wood	1
ceased,	1
and	1
the	1
eye	1
was	1
instantly	1
caught	1
by	1
Pemberley	1
House,	1
situated	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
valley,	1
into	1
which	1
the	1
road	1
with	1
some	1
abruptness	1
wound.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
large,	1
handsome	1
stone	1
building,	1
standing	1
well	1
on	1
rising	1
ground,	1
and	1
backed	1
by	1
a	1
ridge	1
of	1
high	1
woody	1
hills;	1
and	1
in	1
front,	1
a	1
stream	1
of	1
some	1
natural	1
importance	1
was	1
swelled	1
into	1
greater,	1
but	1
without	1
any	1
artificial	1
appearance.	1
Its	1
banks	1
were	1
neither	1
formal	1
nor	1
falsely	1
adorned.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
delighted.	1
She	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
a	1
place	1
for	1
which	1
nature	1
had	1
done	1
more,	1
or	1
where	1
natural	1
beauty	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
little	1
counteracted	1
by	1
an	1
awkward	1
taste.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
warm	1
in	1
their	1
admiration;	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
to	1
be	1
mistress	1
of	1
Pemberley	1
might	1
be	1
something!	1
They	1
descended	1
the	1
hill,	1
crossed	1
the	1
bridge,	1
and	1
drove	1
to	1
the	1
door;	1
and,	1
while	1
examining	1
the	1
nearer	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
all	1
her	1
apprehension	1
of	1
meeting	1
its	1
owner	1
returned.	1
She	1
dreaded	1
lest	1
the	1
chambermaid	1
had	1
been	1
mistaken.	1
On	1
applying	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
place,	1
they	1
were	1
admitted	1
into	1
the	1
hall;	1
and	1
Elizabeth,	1
as	1
they	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
had	1
leisure	1
to	1
wonder	1
at	1
her	1
being	1
where	1
she	1
was.	1
The	1
housekeeper	1
came;	1
a	1
respectable-looking	1
elderly	1
woman,	1
much	1
less	1
fine,	1
and	1
more	1
civil,	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
any	1
notion	1
of	1
finding	1
her.	1
They	1
followed	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
dining-parlour.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
large,	1
well	1
proportioned	1
room,	1
handsomely	1
fitted	1
up.	1
Elizabeth,	1
after	1
slightly	1
surveying	1
it,	1
went	1
to	1
a	1
window	1
to	1
enjoy	1
its	1
prospect.	1
The	1
hill,	1
crowned	1
with	1
wood,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
descended,	1
receiving	1
increased	1
abruptness	1
from	1
the	1
distance,	1
was	1
a	1
beautiful	1
object.	1
Every	1
disposition	1
of	1
the	1
ground	1
was	1
good;	1
and	1
she	1
looked	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
scene,	1
the	1
river,	1
the	1
trees	1
scattered	1
on	1
its	1
banks	1
and	1
the	1
winding	1
of	1
the	1
valley,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
trace	1
it,	1
with	1
delight.	1
As	1
they	1
passed	1
into	1
other	1
rooms	1
these	1
objects	1
were	1
taking	1
different	1
positions;	1
but	1
from	1
every	1
window	1
there	1
were	1
beauties	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
The	1
rooms	1
were	1
lofty	1
and	1
handsome,	1
and	1
their	1
furniture	1
suitable	1
to	1
the	1
fortune	1
of	1
its	1
proprietor;	1
but	1
Elizabeth	1
saw,	1
with	1
admiration	1
of	1
his	1
taste,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
neither	1
gaudy	1
nor	1
uselessly	1
fine;	1
with	1
less	1
of	1
splendour,	1
and	1
more	1
real	1
elegance,	1
than	1
the	1
furniture	1
of	1
Rosings.	1
"And	1
of	1
this	1
place,"	1
thought	1
she,	1
"I	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
mistress!	1
With	1
these	1
rooms	1
I	1
might	1
now	1
have	1
been	1
familiarly	1
acquainted!	1
Instead	1
of	1
viewing	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
stranger,	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
them	1
as	1
my	1
own,	1
and	1
welcomed	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
visitors	1
my	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt.	1
But	1
no,"--recollecting	1
herself--"that	1
could	1
never	1
be;	1
my	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
lost	1
to	1
me;	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
allowed	1
to	1
invite	1
them."	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
lucky	1
recollection--it	1
saved	1
her	1
from	1
something	1
very	1
like	1
regret.	1
She	1
longed	1
to	1
inquire	1
of	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
whether	1
her	1
master	1
was	1
really	1
absent,	1
but	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
courage	1
for	1
it.	1
At	1
length	1
however,	1
the	1
question	1
was	1
asked	1
by	1
her	1
uncle;	1
and	1
she	1
turned	1
away	1
with	1
alarm,	1
while	1
Mrs.	1
Reynolds	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
was,	1
adding,	1
"But	1
we	1
expect	1
him	1
to-morrow,	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
party	1
of	1
friends."	1
How	1
rejoiced	1
was	1
Elizabeth	1
that	1
their	1
own	1
journey	1
had	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
circumstance	1
been	1
delayed	1
a	1
day!	1
Her	1
aunt	1
now	1
called	1
her	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
a	1
picture.	1
She	1
approached	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
likeness	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Wickham,	1
suspended,	1
amongst	1
several	1
other	1
miniatures,	1
over	1
the	1
mantelpiece.	1
Her	1
aunt	1
asked	1
her,	1
smilingly,	1
how	1
she	1
liked	1
it.	1
The	1
housekeeper	1
came	1
forward,	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
picture	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
gentleman,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
her	1
late	1
master's	1
steward,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
by	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
expense.	1
"He	1
is	1
now	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
army,"	1
she	1
added;	1
"but	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
he	1
has	1
turned	1
out	1
very	1
wild."	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
niece	1
with	1
a	1
smile,	1
but	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
return	1
it.	1
"And	1
that,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Reynolds,	1
pointing	1
to	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
miniatures,	1
"is	1
my	1
master--and	1
very	1
like	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
drawn	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
the	1
other--about	1
eight	1
years	1
ago."	1
"I	1
have	1
heard	1
much	1
of	1
your	1
master's	1
fine	1
person,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
picture;	1
"it	1
is	1
a	1
handsome	1
face.	1
But,	1
Lizzy,	1
you	1
can	1
tell	1
us	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
like	1
or	1
not."	1
Mrs.	1
Reynolds	1
respect	1
for	1
Elizabeth	1
seemed	1
to	1
increase	1
on	1
this	1
intimation	1
of	1
her	1
knowing	1
her	1
master.	1
"Does	1
that	1
young	1
lady	1
know	1
Mr.	1
Darcy?"	1
Elizabeth	1
coloured,	1
and	1
said:	1
"A	1
little."	1
"And	1
do	1
not	1
you	1
think	1
him	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
gentleman,	1
ma'am?"	1
"Yes,	1
very	1
handsome."	1
"I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
know	1
none	1
so	1
handsome;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
gallery	1
up	1
stairs	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
a	1
finer,	1
larger	1
picture	1
of	1
him	1
than	1
this.	1
This	1
room	1
was	1
my	1
late	1
master's	1
favourite	1
room,	1
and	1
these	1
miniatures	1
are	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
then.	1
He	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
them."	1
This	1
accounted	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Wickham's	1
being	1
among	1
them.	1
Mrs.	1
Reynolds	1
then	1
directed	1
their	1
attention	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
Miss	1
Darcy,	1
drawn	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
only	1
eight	1
years	1
old.	1
"And	1
is	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
as	1
handsome	1
as	1
her	1
brother?"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner.	1
"Oh!	1
yes--the	1
handsomest	1
young	1
lady	1
that	1
ever	1
was	1
seen;	1
and	1
so	1
accomplished!--She	1
plays	1
and	1
sings	1
all	1
day	1
long.	1
In	1
the	1
next	1
room	1
is	1
a	1
new	1
instrument	1
just	1
come	1
down	1
for	1
her--a	1
present	1
from	1
my	1
master;	1
she	1
comes	1
here	1
to-morrow	1
with	1
him."	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner,	1
whose	1
manners	1
were	1
very	1
easy	1
and	1
pleasant,	1
encouraged	1
her	1
communicativeness	1
by	1
his	1
questions	1
and	1
remarks;	1
Mrs.	1
Reynolds,	1
either	1
by	1
pride	1
or	1
attachment,	1
had	1
evidently	1
great	1
pleasure	1
in	1
talking	1
of	1
her	1
master	1
and	1
his	1
sister.	1
"Is	1
your	1
master	1
much	1
at	1
Pemberley	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
year?"	1
"Not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
wish,	1
sir;	1
but	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
he	1
may	1
spend	1
half	1
his	1
time	1
here;	1
and	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
is	1
always	1
down	1
for	1
the	1
summer	1
months."	1
"Except,"	1
thought	1
Elizabeth,	1
"when	1
she	1
goes	1
to	1
Ramsgate."	1
"If	1
your	1
master	1
would	1
marry,	1
you	1
might	1
see	1
more	1
of	1
him."	1
"Yes,	1
sir;	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
when	1
_that_	1
will	1
be.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
who	1
is	1
good	1
enough	1
for	1
him."	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
smiled.	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
saying,	1
"It	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
his	1
credit,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
think	1
so."	1
"I	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
everybody	1
will	1
say	1
that	1
knows	1
him,"	1
replied	1
the	1
other.	1
Elizabeth	1
thought	1
this	1
was	1
going	1
pretty	1
far;	1
and	1
she	1
listened	1
with	1
increasing	1
astonishment	1
as	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
added,	1
"I	1
have	1
never	1
known	1
a	1
cross	1
word	1
from	1
him	1
in	1
my	1
life,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
him	1
ever	1
since	1
he	1
was	1
four	1
years	1
old."	1
This	1
was	1
praise,	1
of	1
all	1
others	1
most	1
extraordinary,	1
most	1
opposite	1
to	1
her	1
ideas.	1
That	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
good-tempered	1
man	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
firmest	1
opinion.	1
Her	1
keenest	1
attention	1
was	1
awakened;	1
she	1
longed	1
to	1
hear	1
more,	1
and	1
was	1
grateful	1
to	1
her	1
uncle	1
for	1
saying:	1
"There	1
are	1
very	1
few	1
people	1
of	1
whom	1
so	1
much	1
can	1
be	1
said.	1
You	1
are	1
lucky	1
in	1
having	1
such	1
a	1
master."	1
"Yes,	1
sir,	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
am.	1
If	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
meet	1
with	1
a	1
better.	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
observed,	1
that	1
they	1
who	1
are	1
good-natured	1
when	1
children,	1
are	1
good-natured	1
when	1
they	1
grow	1
up;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
the	1
sweetest-tempered,	1
most	1
generous-hearted	1
boy	1
in	1
the	1
world."	1
Elizabeth	1
almost	1
stared	1
at	1
her.	1
"Can	1
this	1
be	1
Mr.	1
Darcy?"	1
thought	1
she.	1
"His	1
father	1
was	1
an	1
excellent	1
man,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner.	1
"Yes,	1
ma'am,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
indeed;	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
will	1
be	1
just	1
like	1
him--just	1
as	1
affable	1
to	1
the	1
poor."	1
Elizabeth	1
listened,	1
wondered,	1
doubted,	1
and	1
was	1
impatient	1
for	1
more.	1
Mrs.	1
Reynolds	1
could	1
interest	1
her	1
on	1
no	1
other	1
point.	1
She	1
related	1
the	1
subjects	1
of	1
the	1
pictures,	1
the	1
dimensions	1
of	1
the	1
rooms,	1
and	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
the	1
furniture,	1
in	1
vain.	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner,	1
highly	1
amused	1
by	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
family	1
prejudice	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
attributed	1
her	1
excessive	1
commendation	1
of	1
her	1
master,	1
soon	1
led	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
subject;	1
and	1
she	1
dwelt	1
with	1
energy	1
on	1
his	1
many	1
merits	1
as	1
they	1
proceeded	1
together	1
up	1
the	1
great	1
staircase.	1
"He	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
landlord,	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
master,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"that	1
ever	1
lived;	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
wild	1
young	1
men	1
nowadays,	1
who	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
but	1
themselves.	1
There	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
tenants	1
or	1
servants	1
but	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
good	1
name.	1
Some	1
people	1
call	1
him	1
proud;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
anything	1
of	1
it.	1
To	1
my	1
fancy,	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
because	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
rattle	1
away	1
like	1
other	1
young	1
men."	1
"In	1
what	1
an	1
amiable	1
light	1
does	1
this	1
place	1
him!"	1
thought	1
Elizabeth.	1
"This	1
fine	1
account	1
of	1
him,"	1
whispered	1
her	1
aunt	1
as	1
they	1
walked,	1
"is	1
not	1
quite	1
consistent	1
with	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
our	1
poor	1
friend."	1
"Perhaps	1
we	1
might	1
be	1
deceived."	1
"That	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
likely;	1
our	1
authority	1
was	1
too	1
good."	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
spacious	1
lobby	1
above	1
they	1
were	1
shown	1
into	1
a	1
very	1
pretty	1
sitting-room,	1
lately	1
fitted	1
up	1
with	1
greater	1
elegance	1
and	1
lightness	1
than	1
the	1
apartments	1
below;	1
and	1
were	1
informed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
but	1
just	1
done	1
to	1
give	1
pleasure	1
to	1
Miss	1
Darcy,	1
who	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
liking	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
when	1
last	1
at	1
Pemberley.	1
"He	1
is	1
certainly	1
a	1
good	1
brother,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
as	1
she	1
walked	1
towards	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
windows.	1
Mrs.	1
Reynolds	1
anticipated	1
Miss	1
Darcy's	1
delight,	1
when	1
she	1
should	1
enter	1
the	1
room.	1
"And	1
this	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
him,"	1
she	1
added.	1
"Whatever	1
can	1
give	1
his	1
sister	1
any	1
pleasure	1
is	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
in	1
a	1
moment.	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
for	1
her."	1
The	1
picture-gallery,	1
and	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
bedrooms,	1
were	1
all	1
that	1
remained	1
to	1
be	1
shown.	1
In	1
the	1
former	1
were	1
many	1
good	1
paintings;	1
but	1
Elizabeth	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
art;	1
and	1
from	1
such	1
as	1
had	1
been	1
already	1
visible	1
below,	1
she	1
had	1
willingly	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
some	1
drawings	1
of	1
Miss	1
Darcy's,	1
in	1
crayons,	1
whose	1
subjects	1
were	1
usually	1
more	1
interesting,	1
and	1
also	1
more	1
intelligible.	1
In	1
the	1
gallery	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
family	1
portraits,	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
have	1
little	1
to	1
fix	1
the	1
attention	1
of	1
a	1
stranger.	1
Elizabeth	1
walked	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
the	1
only	1
face	1
whose	1
features	1
would	1
be	1
known	1
to	1
her.	1
At	1
last	1
it	1
arrested	1
her--and	1
she	1
beheld	1
a	1
striking	1
resemblance	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
smile	1
over	1
the	1
face	1
as	1
she	1
remembered	1
to	1
have	1
sometimes	1
seen	1
when	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her.	1
She	1
stood	1
several	1
minutes	1
before	1
the	1
picture,	1
in	1
earnest	1
contemplation,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
it	1
again	1
before	1
they	1
quitted	1
the	1
gallery.	1
Mrs.	1
Reynolds	1
informed	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
in	1
his	1
father's	1
lifetime.	1
There	1
was	1
certainly	1
at	1
this	1
moment,	1
in	1
Elizabeth's	1
mind,	1
a	1
more	1
gentle	1
sensation	1
towards	1
the	1
original	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
felt	1
at	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
their	1
acquaintance.	1
The	1
commendation	1
bestowed	1
on	1
him	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Reynolds	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
trifling	1
nature.	1
What	1
praise	1
is	1
more	1
valuable	1
than	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
an	1
intelligent	1
servant?	1
As	1
a	1
brother,	1
a	1
landlord,	1
a	1
master,	1
she	1
considered	1
how	1
many	1
people's	1
happiness	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
guardianship!--how	1
much	1
of	1
pleasure	1
or	1
pain	1
was	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
bestow!--how	1
much	1
of	1
good	1
or	1
evil	1
must	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
him!	1
Every	1
idea	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
forward	1
by	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
was	1
favourable	1
to	1
his	1
character,	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
before	1
the	1
canvas	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
represented,	1
and	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
herself,	1
she	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
regard	1
with	1
a	1
deeper	1
sentiment	1
of	1
gratitude	1
than	1
it	1
had	1
ever	1
raised	1
before;	1
she	1
remembered	1
its	1
warmth,	1
and	1
softened	1
its	1
impropriety	1
of	1
expression.	1
When	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
that	1
was	1
open	1
to	1
general	1
inspection	1
had	1
been	1
seen,	1
they	1
returned	1
downstairs,	1
and,	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
were	1
consigned	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
gardener,	1
who	1
met	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
hall-door.	1
As	1
they	1
walked	1
across	1
the	1
hall	1
towards	1
the	1
river,	1
Elizabeth	1
turned	1
back	1
to	1
look	1
again;	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
stopped	1
also,	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
former	1
was	1
conjecturing	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
date	1
of	1
the	1
building,	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
it	1
himself	1
suddenly	1
came	1
forward	1
from	1
the	1
road,	1
which	1
led	1
behind	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
stables.	1
They	1
were	1
within	1
twenty	1
yards	1
of	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
so	1
abrupt	1
was	1
his	1
appearance,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
avoid	1
his	1
sight.	1
Their	1
eyes	1
instantly	1
met,	1
and	1
the	1
cheeks	1
of	1
both	1
were	1
overspread	1
with	1
the	1
deepest	1
blush.	1
He	1
absolutely	1
started,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
seemed	1
immovable	1
from	1
surprise;	1
but	1
shortly	1
recovering	1
himself,	1
advanced	1
towards	1
the	1
party,	1
and	1
spoke	1
to	1
Elizabeth,	1
if	1
not	1
in	1
terms	1
of	1
perfect	1
composure,	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
perfect	1
civility.	1
She	1
had	1
instinctively	1
turned	1
away;	1
but	1
stopping	1
on	1
his	1
approach,	1
received	1
his	1
compliments	1
with	1
an	1
embarrassment	1
impossible	1
to	1
be	1
overcome.	1
Had	1
his	1
first	1
appearance,	1
or	1
his	1
resemblance	1
to	1
the	1
picture	1
they	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
examining,	1
been	1
insufficient	1
to	1
assure	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
that	1
they	1
now	1
saw	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
the	1
gardener's	1
expression	1
of	1
surprise,	1
on	1
beholding	1
his	1
master,	1
must	1
immediately	1
have	1
told	1
it.	1
They	1
stood	1
a	1
little	1
aloof	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
their	1
niece,	1
who,	1
astonished	1
and	1
confused,	1
scarcely	1
dared	1
lift	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
answer	1
she	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
civil	1
inquiries	1
after	1
her	1
family.	1
Amazed	1
at	1
the	1
alteration	1
of	1
his	1
manner	1
since	1
they	1
last	1
parted,	1
every	1
sentence	1
that	1
he	1
uttered	1
was	1
increasing	1
her	1
embarrassment;	1
and	1
every	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
impropriety	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
found	1
there	1
recurring	1
to	1
her	1
mind,	1
the	1
few	1
minutes	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
continued	1
were	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
uncomfortable	1
in	1
her	1
life.	1
Nor	1
did	1
he	1
seem	1
much	1
more	1
at	1
ease;	1
when	1
he	1
spoke,	1
his	1
accent	1
had	1
none	1
of	1
its	1
usual	1
sedateness;	1
and	1
he	1
repeated	1
his	1
inquiries	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
her	1
having	1
left	1
Longbourn,	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
having	1
stayed	1
in	1
Derbyshire,	1
so	1
often,	1
and	1
in	1
so	1
hurried	1
a	1
way,	1
as	1
plainly	1
spoke	1
the	1
distraction	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts.	1
At	1
length	1
every	1
idea	1
seemed	1
to	1
fail	1
him;	1
and,	1
after	1
standing	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word,	1
he	1
suddenly	1
recollected	1
himself,	1
and	1
took	1
leave.	1
The	1
others	1
then	1
joined	1
her,	1
and	1
expressed	1
admiration	1
of	1
his	1
figure;	1
but	1
Elizabeth	1
heard	1
not	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
wholly	1
engrossed	1
by	1
her	1
own	1
feelings,	1
followed	1
them	1
in	1
silence.	1
She	1
was	1
overpowered	1
by	1
shame	1
and	1
vexation.	1
Her	1
coming	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
unfortunate,	1
the	1
most	1
ill-judged	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world!	1
How	1
strange	1
it	1
must	1
appear	1
to	1
him!	1
In	1
what	1
a	1
disgraceful	1
light	1
might	1
it	1
not	1
strike	1
so	1
vain	1
a	1
man!	1
It	1
might	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
purposely	1
thrown	1
herself	1
in	1
his	1
way	1
again!	1
Oh!	1
why	1
did	1
she	1
come?	1
Or,	1
why	1
did	1
he	1
thus	1
come	1
a	1
day	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
expected?	1
Had	1
they	1
been	1
only	1
ten	1
minutes	1
sooner,	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
beyond	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
his	1
discrimination;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
that	1
moment	1
arrived--that	1
moment	1
alighted	1
from	1
his	1
horse	1
or	1
his	1
carriage.	1
She	1
blushed	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
over	1
the	1
perverseness	1
of	1
the	1
meeting.	1
And	1
his	1
behaviour,	1
so	1
strikingly	1
altered--what	1
could	1
it	1
mean?	1
That	1
he	1
should	1
even	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
amazing!--but	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
such	1
civility,	1
to	1
inquire	1
after	1
her	1
family!	1
Never	1
in	1
her	1
life	1
had	1
she	1
seen	1
his	1
manners	1
so	1
little	1
dignified,	1
never	1
had	1
he	1
spoken	1
with	1
such	1
gentleness	1
as	1
on	1
this	1
unexpected	1
meeting.	1
What	1
a	1
contrast	1
did	1
it	1
offer	1
to	1
his	1
last	1
address	1
in	1
Rosings	1
Park,	1
when	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
letter	1
into	1
her	1
hand!	1
She	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
think,	1
or	1
how	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
it.	1
They	1
had	1
now	1
entered	1
a	1
beautiful	1
walk	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
every	1
step	1
was	1
bringing	1
forward	1
a	1
nobler	1
fall	1
of	1
ground,	1
or	1
a	1
finer	1
reach	1
of	1
the	1
woods	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
approaching;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
time	1
before	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
sensible	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
it;	1
and,	1
though	1
she	1
answered	1
mechanically	1
to	1
the	1
repeated	1
appeals	1
of	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt,	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
direct	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
such	1
objects	1
as	1
they	1
pointed	1
out,	1
she	1
distinguished	1
no	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
scene.	1
Her	1
thoughts	1
were	1
all	1
fixed	1
on	1
that	1
one	1
spot	1
of	1
Pemberley	1
House,	1
whichever	1
it	1
might	1
be,	1
where	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
then	1
was.	1
She	1
longed	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
was	1
passing	1
in	1
his	1
mind--in	1
what	1
manner	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
her,	1
and	1
whether,	1
in	1
defiance	1
of	1
everything,	1
she	1
was	1
still	1
dear	1
to	1
him.	1
Perhaps	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
civil	1
only	1
because	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
at	1
ease;	1
yet	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
_that_	1
in	1
his	1
voice	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
like	1
ease.	1
Whether	1
he	1
had	1
felt	1
more	1
of	1
pain	1
or	1
of	1
pleasure	1
in	1
seeing	1
her	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
tell,	1
but	1
he	1
certainly	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
with	1
composure.	1
At	1
length,	1
however,	1
the	1
remarks	1
of	1
her	1
companions	1
on	1
her	1
absence	1
of	1
mind	1
aroused	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
appearing	1
more	1
like	1
herself.	1
They	1
entered	1
the	1
woods,	1
and	1
bidding	1
adieu	1
to	1
the	1
river	1
for	1
a	1
while,	1
ascended	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
higher	1
grounds;	1
when,	1
in	1
spots	1
where	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
gave	1
the	1
eye	1
power	1
to	1
wander,	1
were	1
many	1
charming	1
views	1
of	1
the	1
valley,	1
the	1
opposite	1
hills,	1
with	1
the	1
long	1
range	1
of	1
woods	1
overspreading	1
many,	1
and	1
occasionally	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
stream.	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
expressed	1
a	1
wish	1
of	1
going	1
round	1
the	1
whole	1
park,	1
but	1
feared	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
beyond	1
a	1
walk.	1
With	1
a	1
triumphant	1
smile	1
they	1
were	1
told	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
ten	1
miles	1
round.	1
It	1
settled	1
the	1
matter;	1
and	1
they	1
pursued	1
the	1
accustomed	1
circuit;	1
which	1
brought	1
them	1
again,	1
after	1
some	1
time,	1
in	1
a	1
descent	1
among	1
hanging	1
woods,	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
narrowest	1
parts.	1
They	1
crossed	1
it	1
by	1
a	1
simple	1
bridge,	1
in	1
character	1
with	1
the	1
general	1
air	1
of	1
the	1
scene;	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
spot	1
less	1
adorned	1
than	1
any	1
they	1
had	1
yet	1
visited;	1
and	1
the	1
valley,	1
here	1
contracted	1
into	1
a	1
glen,	1
allowed	1
room	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
stream,	1
and	1
a	1
narrow	1
walk	1
amidst	1
the	1
rough	1
coppice-wood	1
which	1
bordered	1
it.	1
Elizabeth	1
longed	1
to	1
explore	1
its	1
windings;	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
crossed	1
the	1
bridge,	1
and	1
perceived	1
their	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
house,	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
great	1
walker,	1
could	1
go	1
no	1
farther,	1
and	1
thought	1
only	1
of	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
carriage	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible.	1
Her	1
niece	1
was,	1
therefore,	1
obliged	1
to	1
submit,	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
way	1
towards	1
the	1
house	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
in	1
the	1
nearest	1
direction;	1
but	1
their	1
progress	1
was	1
slow,	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner,	1
though	1
seldom	1
able	1
to	1
indulge	1
the	1
taste,	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
fishing,	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
engaged	1
in	1
watching	1
the	1
occasional	1
appearance	1
of	1
some	1
trout	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
about	1
them,	1
that	1
he	1
advanced	1
but	1
little.	1
Whilst	1
wandering	1
on	1
in	1
this	1
slow	1
manner,	1
they	1
were	1
again	1
surprised,	1
and	1
Elizabeth's	1
astonishment	1
was	1
quite	1
equal	1
to	1
what	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
first,	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
approaching	1
them,	1
and	1
at	1
no	1
great	1
distance.	1
The	1
walk	1
being	1
here	1
less	1
sheltered	1
than	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
allowed	1
them	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
before	1
they	1
met.	1
Elizabeth,	1
however	1
astonished,	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
more	1
prepared	1
for	1
an	1
interview	1
than	1
before,	1
and	1
resolved	1
to	1
appear	1
and	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
calmness,	1
if	1
he	1
really	1
intended	1
to	1
meet	1
them.	1
For	1
a	1
few	1
moments,	1
indeed,	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
probably	1
strike	1
into	1
some	1
other	1
path.	1
The	1
idea	1
lasted	1
while	1
a	1
turning	1
in	1
the	1
walk	1
concealed	1
him	1
from	1
their	1
view;	1
the	1
turning	1
past,	1
he	1
was	1
immediately	1
before	1
them.	1
With	1
a	1
glance,	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
none	1
of	1
his	1
recent	1
civility;	1
and,	1
to	1
imitate	1
his	1
politeness,	1
she	1
began,	1
as	1
they	1
met,	1
to	1
admire	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
place;	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
got	1
beyond	1
the	1
words	1
"delightful,"	1
and	1
"charming,"	1
when	1
some	1
unlucky	1
recollections	1
obtruded,	1
and	1
she	1
fancied	1
that	1
praise	1
of	1
Pemberley	1
from	1
her	1
might	1
be	1
mischievously	1
construed.	1
Her	1
colour	1
changed,	1
and	1
she	1
said	1
no	1
more.	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
was	1
standing	1
a	1
little	1
behind;	1
and	1
on	1
her	1
pausing,	1
he	1
asked	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
would	1
do	1
him	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
introducing	1
him	1
to	1
her	1
friends.	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
stroke	1
of	1
civility	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
unprepared;	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
suppress	1
a	1
smile	1
at	1
his	1
being	1
now	1
seeking	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
very	1
people	1
against	1
whom	1
his	1
pride	1
had	1
revolted	1
in	1
his	1
offer	1
to	1
herself.	1
"What	1
will	1
be	1
his	1
surprise,"	1
thought	1
she,	1
"when	1
he	1
knows	1
who	1
they	1
are?	1
He	1
takes	1
them	1
now	1
for	1
people	1
of	1
fashion."	1
The	1
introduction,	1
however,	1
was	1
immediately	1
made;	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
named	1
their	1
relationship	1
to	1
herself,	1
she	1
stole	1
a	1
sly	1
look	1
at	1
him,	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
he	1
bore	1
it,	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
without	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
his	1
decamping	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
from	1
such	1
disgraceful	1
companions.	1
That	1
he	1
was	1
_surprised_	1
by	1
the	1
connection	1
was	1
evident;	1
he	1
sustained	1
it,	1
however,	1
with	1
fortitude,	1
and	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
going	1
away,	1
turned	1
back	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
entered	1
into	1
conversation	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner.	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
be	1
pleased,	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
triumph.	1
It	1
was	1
consoling	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
know	1
she	1
had	1
some	1
relations	1
for	1
whom	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
blush.	1
She	1
listened	1
most	1
attentively	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
passed	1
between	1
them,	1
and	1
gloried	1
in	1
every	1
expression,	1
every	1
sentence	1
of	1
her	1
uncle,	1
which	1
marked	1
his	1
intelligence,	1
his	1
taste,	1
or	1
his	1
good	1
manners.	1
The	1
conversation	1
soon	1
turned	1
upon	1
fishing;	1
and	1
she	1
heard	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
invite	1
him,	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
civility,	1
to	1
fish	1
there	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
he	1
chose	1
while	1
he	1
continued	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
offering	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
to	1
supply	1
him	1
with	1
fishing	1
tackle,	1
and	1
pointing	1
out	1
those	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
stream	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
usually	1
most	1
sport.	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
who	1
was	1
walking	1
arm-in-arm	1
with	1
Elizabeth,	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
look	1
expressive	1
of	1
wonder.	1
Elizabeth	1
said	1
nothing,	1
but	1
it	1
gratified	1
her	1
exceedingly;	1
the	1
compliment	1
must	1
be	1
all	1
for	1
herself.	1
Her	1
astonishment,	1
however,	1
was	1
extreme,	1
and	1
continually	1
was	1
she	1
repeating,	1
"Why	1
is	1
he	1
so	1
altered?	1
From	1
what	1
can	1
it	1
proceed?	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
for	1
_me_--it	1
cannot	1
be	1
for	1
_my_	1
sake	1
that	1
his	1
manners	1
are	1
thus	1
softened.	1
My	1
reproofs	1
at	1
Hunsford	1
could	1
not	1
work	1
such	1
a	1
change	1
as	1
this.	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
still	1
love	1
me."	1
After	1
walking	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
the	1
two	1
ladies	1
in	1
front,	1
the	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
behind,	1
on	1
resuming	1
their	1
places,	1
after	1
descending	1
to	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
for	1
the	1
better	1
inspection	1
of	1
some	1
curious	1
water-plant,	1
there	1
chanced	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
alteration.	1
It	1
originated	1
in	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
who,	1
fatigued	1
by	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
found	1
Elizabeth's	1
arm	1
inadequate	1
to	1
her	1
support,	1
and	1
consequently	1
preferred	1
her	1
husband's.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
took	1
her	1
place	1
by	1
her	1
niece,	1
and	1
they	1
walked	1
on	1
together.	1
After	1
a	1
short	1
silence,	1
the	1
lady	1
first	1
spoke.	1
She	1
wished	1
him	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
assured	1
of	1
his	1
absence	1
before	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place,	1
and	1
accordingly	1
began	1
by	1
observing,	1
that	1
his	1
arrival	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
unexpected--"for	1
your	1
housekeeper,"	1
she	1
added,	1
"informed	1
us	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
certainly	1
not	1
be	1
here	1
till	1
to-morrow;	1
and	1
indeed,	1
before	1
we	1
left	1
Bakewell,	1
we	1
understood	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
immediately	1
expected	1
in	1
the	1
country."	1
He	1
acknowledged	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
it	1
all,	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
business	1
with	1
his	1
steward	1
had	1
occasioned	1
his	1
coming	1
forward	1
a	1
few	1
hours	1
before	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
travelling.	1
"They	1
will	1
join	1
me	1
early	1
to-morrow,"	1
he	1
continued,	1
"and	1
among	1
them	1
are	1
some	1
who	1
will	1
claim	1
an	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
you--Mr.	1
Bingley	1
and	1
his	1
sisters."	1
Elizabeth	1
answered	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
slight	1
bow.	1
Her	1
thoughts	1
were	1
instantly	1
driven	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
name	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
last	1
mentioned	1
between	1
them;	1
and,	1
if	1
she	1
might	1
judge	1
by	1
his	1
complexion,	1
_his_	1
mind	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
differently	1
engaged.	1
"There	1
is	1
also	1
one	1
other	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
party,"	1
he	1
continued	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
"who	1
more	1
particularly	1
wishes	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
to	1
you.	1
Will	1
you	1
allow	1
me,	1
or	1
do	1
I	1
ask	1
too	1
much,	1
to	1
introduce	1
my	1
sister	1
to	1
your	1
acquaintance	1
during	1
your	1
stay	1
at	1
Lambton?"	1
The	1
surprise	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
application	1
was	1
great	1
indeed;	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
great	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
know	1
in	1
what	1
manner	1
she	1
acceded	1
to	1
it.	1
She	1
immediately	1
felt	1
that	1
whatever	1
desire	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
might	1
have	1
of	1
being	1
acquainted	1
with	1
her	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
her	1
brother,	1
and,	1
without	1
looking	1
farther,	1
it	1
was	1
satisfactory;	1
it	1
was	1
gratifying	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
his	1
resentment	1
had	1
not	1
made	1
him	1
think	1
really	1
ill	1
of	1
her.	1
They	1
now	1
walked	1
on	1
in	1
silence,	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
deep	1
in	1
thought.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
not	1
comfortable;	1
that	1
was	1
impossible;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
flattered	1
and	1
pleased.	1
His	1
wish	1
of	1
introducing	1
his	1
sister	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
a	1
compliment	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
kind.	1
They	1
soon	1
outstripped	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
carriage,	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
were	1
half	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
mile	1
behind.	1
He	1
then	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
walk	1
into	1
the	1
house--but	1
she	1
declared	1
herself	1
not	1
tired,	1
and	1
they	1
stood	1
together	1
on	1
the	1
lawn.	1
At	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
much	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
said,	1
and	1
silence	1
was	1
very	1
awkward.	1
She	1
wanted	1
to	1
talk,	1
but	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
embargo	1
on	1
every	1
subject.	1
At	1
last	1
she	1
recollected	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
travelling,	1
and	1
they	1
talked	1
of	1
Matlock	1
and	1
Dove	1
Dale	1
with	1
great	1
perseverance.	1
Yet	1
time	1
and	1
her	1
aunt	1
moved	1
slowly--and	1
her	1
patience	1
and	1
her	1
ideas	1
were	1
nearly	1
worn	1
out	1
before	1
the	1
tete-a-tete	1
was	1
over.	1
On	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner's	1
coming	1
up	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
pressed	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
take	1
some	1
refreshment;	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
declined,	1
and	1
they	1
parted	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
with	1
utmost	1
politeness.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
handed	1
the	1
ladies	1
into	1
the	1
carriage;	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
drove	1
off,	1
Elizabeth	1
saw	1
him	1
walking	1
slowly	1
towards	1
the	1
house.	1
The	1
observations	1
of	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
now	1
began;	1
and	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
pronounced	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
infinitely	1
superior	1
to	1
anything	1
they	1
had	1
expected.	1
"He	1
is	1
perfectly	1
well	1
behaved,	1
polite,	1
and	1
unassuming,"	1
said	1
her	1
uncle.	1
"There	1
_is_	1
something	1
a	1
little	1
stately	1
in	1
him,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,"	1
replied	1
her	1
aunt,	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
confined	1
to	1
his	1
air,	1
and	1
is	1
not	1
unbecoming.	1
I	1
can	1
now	1
say	1
with	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
that	1
though	1
some	1
people	1
may	1
call	1
him	1
proud,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
nothing	1
of	1
it."	1
"I	1
was	1
never	1
more	1
surprised	1
than	1
by	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
us.	1
It	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
civil;	1
it	1
was	1
really	1
attentive;	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
necessity	1
for	1
such	1
attention.	1
His	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
very	1
trifling."	1
"To	1
be	1
sure,	1
Lizzy,"	1
said	1
her	1
aunt,	1
"he	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
handsome	1
as	1
Wickham;	1
or,	1
rather,	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
Wickham's	1
countenance,	1
for	1
his	1
features	1
are	1
perfectly	1
good.	1
But	1
how	1
came	1
you	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
disagreeable?"	1
Elizabeth	1
excused	1
herself	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
could;	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
liked	1
him	1
better	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
met	1
in	1
Kent	1
than	1
before,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
him	1
so	1
pleasant	1
as	1
this	1
morning.	1
"But	1
perhaps	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
whimsical	1
in	1
his	1
civilities,"	1
replied	1
her	1
uncle.	1
"Your	1
great	1
men	1
often	1
are;	1
and	1
therefore	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
take	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
word,	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
change	1
his	1
mind	1
another	1
day,	1
and	1
warn	1
me	1
off	1
his	1
grounds."	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
entirely	1
misunderstood	1
his	1
character,	1
but	1
said	1
nothing.	1
"From	1
what	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
of	1
him,"	1
continued	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
"I	1
really	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
behaved	1
in	1
so	1
cruel	1
a	1
way	1
by	1
anybody	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
by	1
poor	1
Wickham.	1
He	1
has	1
not	1
an	1
ill-natured	1
look.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
pleasing	1
about	1
his	1
mouth	1
when	1
he	1
speaks.	1
And	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
of	1
dignity	1
in	1
his	1
countenance	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
one	1
an	1
unfavourable	1
idea	1
of	1
his	1
heart.	1
But,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
the	1
good	1
lady	1
who	1
showed	1
us	1
his	1
house	1
did	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
most	1
flaming	1
character!	1
I	1
could	1
hardly	1
help	1
laughing	1
aloud	1
sometimes.	1
But	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
liberal	1
master,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
and	1
_that_	1
in	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
a	1
servant	1
comprehends	1
every	1
virtue."	1
Elizabeth	1
here	1
felt	1
herself	1
called	1
on	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
in	1
vindication	1
of	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
Wickham;	1
and	1
therefore	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
understand,	1
in	1
as	1
guarded	1
a	1
manner	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
that	1
by	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
from	1
his	1
relations	1
in	1
Kent,	1
his	1
actions	1
were	1
capable	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
construction;	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
character	1
was	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
so	1
faulty,	1
nor	1
Wickham's	1
so	1
amiable,	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
considered	1
in	1
Hertfordshire.	1
In	1
confirmation	1
of	1
this,	1
she	1
related	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
pecuniary	1
transactions	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
connected,	1
without	1
actually	1
naming	1
her	1
authority,	1
but	1
stating	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
such	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
relied	1
on.	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
was	1
surprised	1
and	1
concerned;	1
but	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
approaching	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
her	1
former	1
pleasures,	1
every	1
idea	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
charm	1
of	1
recollection;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
engaged	1
in	1
pointing	1
out	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
all	1
the	1
interesting	1
spots	1
in	1
its	1
environs	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
anything	1
else.	1
Fatigued	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
by	1
the	1
morning's	1
walk	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
sooner	1
dined	1
than	1
she	1
set	1
off	1
again	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
her	1
former	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
the	1
evening	1
was	1
spent	1
in	1
the	1
satisfactions	1
of	1
a	1
intercourse	1
renewed	1
after	1
many	1
years'	1
discontinuance.	1
The	1
occurrences	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
were	1
too	1
full	1
of	1
interest	1
to	1
leave	1
Elizabeth	1
much	1
attention	1
for	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
new	1
friends;	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
but	1
think,	1
and	1
think	1
with	1
wonder,	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
civility,	1
and,	1
above	1
all,	1
of	1
his	1
wishing	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
acquainted	1
with	1
his	1
sister.	1
Chapter	1
44	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
settled	1
it	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
would	1
bring	1
his	1
sister	1
to	1
visit	1
her	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
after	1
her	1
reaching	1
Pemberley;	1
and	1
was	1
consequently	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
morning.	1
But	1
her	1
conclusion	1
was	1
false;	1
for	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
morning	1
after	1
their	1
arrival	1
at	1
Lambton,	1
these	1
visitors	1
came.	1
They	1
had	1
been	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
place	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
their	1
new	1
friends,	1
and	1
were	1
just	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
to	1
dress	1
themselves	1
for	1
dining	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
family,	1
when	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
carriage	1
drew	1
them	1
to	1
a	1
window,	1
and	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
gentleman	1
and	1
a	1
lady	1
in	1
a	1
curricle	1
driving	1
up	1
the	1
street.	1
Elizabeth	1
immediately	1
recognizing	1
the	1
livery,	1
guessed	1
what	1
it	1
meant,	1
and	1
imparted	1
no	1
small	1
degree	1
of	1
her	1
surprise	1
to	1
her	1
relations	1
by	1
acquainting	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
honour	1
which	1
she	1
expected.	1
Her	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
were	1
all	1
amazement;	1
and	1
the	1
embarrassment	1
of	1
her	1
manner	1
as	1
she	1
spoke,	1
joined	1
to	1
the	1
circumstance	1
itself,	1
and	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
circumstances	1
of	1
the	1
preceding	1
day,	1
opened	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
new	1
idea	1
on	1
the	1
business.	1
Nothing	1
had	1
ever	1
suggested	1
it	1
before,	1
but	1
they	1
felt	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
of	1
accounting	1
for	1
such	1
attentions	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
quarter	1
than	1
by	1
supposing	1
a	1
partiality	1
for	1
their	1
niece.	1
While	1
these	1
newly-born	1
notions	1
were	1
passing	1
in	1
their	1
heads,	1
the	1
perturbation	1
of	1
Elizabeth's	1
feelings	1
was	1
at	1
every	1
moment	1
increasing.	1
She	1
was	1
quite	1
amazed	1
at	1
her	1
own	1
discomposure;	1
but	1
amongst	1
other	1
causes	1
of	1
disquiet,	1
she	1
dreaded	1
lest	1
the	1
partiality	1
of	1
the	1
brother	1
should	1
have	1
said	1
too	1
much	1
in	1
her	1
favour;	1
and,	1
more	1
than	1
commonly	1
anxious	1
to	1
please,	1
she	1
naturally	1
suspected	1
that	1
every	1
power	1
of	1
pleasing	1
would	1
fail	1
her.	1
She	1
retreated	1
from	1
the	1
window,	1
fearful	1
of	1
being	1
seen;	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
walked	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room,	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
compose	1
herself,	1
saw	1
such	1
looks	1
of	1
inquiring	1
surprise	1
in	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
as	1
made	1
everything	1
worse.	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
and	1
her	1
brother	1
appeared,	1
and	1
this	1
formidable	1
introduction	1
took	1
place.	1
With	1
astonishment	1
did	1
Elizabeth	1
see	1
that	1
her	1
new	1
acquaintance	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
much	1
embarrassed	1
as	1
herself.	1
Since	1
her	1
being	1
at	1
Lambton,	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
that	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
proud;	1
but	1
the	1
observation	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
minutes	1
convinced	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
only	1
exceedingly	1
shy.	1
She	1
found	1
it	1
difficult	1
to	1
obtain	1
even	1
a	1
word	1
from	1
her	1
beyond	1
a	1
monosyllable.	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
was	1
tall,	1
and	1
on	1
a	1
larger	1
scale	1
than	1
Elizabeth;	1
and,	1
though	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
sixteen,	1
her	1
figure	1
was	1
formed,	1
and	1
her	1
appearance	1
womanly	1
and	1
graceful.	1
She	1
was	1
less	1
handsome	1
than	1
her	1
brother;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
sense	1
and	1
good	1
humour	1
in	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
her	1
manners	1
were	1
perfectly	1
unassuming	1
and	1
gentle.	1
Elizabeth,	1
who	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
her	1
as	1
acute	1
and	1
unembarrassed	1
an	1
observer	1
as	1
ever	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
had	1
been,	1
was	1
much	1
relieved	1
by	1
discerning	1
such	1
different	1
feelings.	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
long	1
been	1
together	1
before	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
Bingley	1
was	1
also	1
coming	1
to	1
wait	1
on	1
her;	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
barely	1
time	1
to	1
express	1
her	1
satisfaction,	1
and	1
prepare	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
visitor,	1
when	1
Bingley's	1
quick	1
step	1
was	1
heard	1
on	1
the	1
stairs,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
room.	1
All	1
Elizabeth's	1
anger	1
against	1
him	1
had	1
been	1
long	1
done	1
away;	1
but	1
had	1
she	1
still	1
felt	1
any,	1
it	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
stood	1
its	1
ground	1
against	1
the	1
unaffected	1
cordiality	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
expressed	1
himself	1
on	1
seeing	1
her	1
again.	1
He	1
inquired	1
in	1
a	1
friendly,	1
though	1
general	1
way,	1
after	1
her	1
family,	1
and	1
looked	1
and	1
spoke	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
good-humoured	1
ease	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
done.	1
To	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
he	1
was	1
scarcely	1
a	1
less	1
interesting	1
personage	1
than	1
to	1
herself.	1
They	1
had	1
long	1
wished	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
The	1
whole	1
party	1
before	1
them,	1
indeed,	1
excited	1
a	1
lively	1
attention.	1
The	1
suspicions	1
which	1
had	1
just	1
arisen	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
and	1
their	1
niece	1
directed	1
their	1
observation	1
towards	1
each	1
with	1
an	1
earnest	1
though	1
guarded	1
inquiry;	1
and	1
they	1
soon	1
drew	1
from	1
those	1
inquiries	1
the	1
full	1
conviction	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
least	1
knew	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
love.	1
Of	1
the	1
lady's	1
sensations	1
they	1
remained	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
doubt;	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
gentleman	1
was	1
overflowing	1
with	1
admiration	1
was	1
evident	1
enough.	1
Elizabeth,	1
on	1
her	1
side,	1
had	1
much	1
to	1
do.	1
She	1
wanted	1
to	1
ascertain	1
the	1
feelings	1
of	1
each	1
of	1
her	1
visitors;	1
she	1
wanted	1
to	1
compose	1
her	1
own,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
herself	1
agreeable	1
to	1
all;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
object,	1
where	1
she	1
feared	1
most	1
to	1
fail,	1
she	1
was	1
most	1
sure	1
of	1
success,	1
for	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
give	1
pleasure	1
were	1
prepossessed	1
in	1
her	1
favour.	1
Bingley	1
was	1
ready,	1
Georgiana	1
was	1
eager,	1
and	1
Darcy	1
determined,	1
to	1
be	1
pleased.	1
In	1
seeing	1
Bingley,	1
her	1
thoughts	1
naturally	1
flew	1
to	1
her	1
sister;	1
and,	1
oh!	1
how	1
ardently	1
did	1
she	1
long	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
were	1
directed	1
in	1
a	1
like	1
manner.	1
Sometimes	1
she	1
could	1
fancy	1
that	1
he	1
talked	1
less	1
than	1
on	1
former	1
occasions,	1
and	1
once	1
or	1
twice	1
pleased	1
herself	1
with	1
the	1
notion	1
that,	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
her,	1
he	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
trace	1
a	1
resemblance.	1
But,	1
though	1
this	1
might	1
be	1
imaginary,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
deceived	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
behaviour	1
to	1
Miss	1
Darcy,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
set	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
rival	1
to	1
Jane.	1
No	1
look	1
appeared	1
on	1
either	1
side	1
that	1
spoke	1
particular	1
regard.	1
Nothing	1
occurred	1
between	1
them	1
that	1
could	1
justify	1
the	1
hopes	1
of	1
his	1
sister.	1
On	1
this	1
point	1
she	1
was	1
soon	1
satisfied;	1
and	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
little	1
circumstances	1
occurred	1
ere	1
they	1
parted,	1
which,	1
in	1
her	1
anxious	1
interpretation,	1
denoted	1
a	1
recollection	1
of	1
Jane	1
not	1
untinctured	1
by	1
tenderness,	1
and	1
a	1
wish	1
of	1
saying	1
more	1
that	1
might	1
lead	1
to	1
the	1
mention	1
of	1
her,	1
had	1
he	1
dared.	1
He	1
observed	1
to	1
her,	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
talking	1
together,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
which	1
had	1
something	1
of	1
real	1
regret,	1
that	1
it	1
"was	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
time	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
seeing	1
her;"	1
and,	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
reply,	1
he	1
added,	1
"It	1
is	1
above	1
eight	1
months.	1
We	1
have	1
not	1
met	1
since	1
the	1
26th	1
of	1
November,	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
dancing	1
together	1
at	1
Netherfield."	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
find	1
his	1
memory	1
so	1
exact;	1
and	1
he	1
afterwards	1
took	1
occasion	1
to	1
ask	1
her,	1
when	1
unattended	1
to	1
by	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
rest,	1
whether	1
_all_	1
her	1
sisters	1
were	1
at	1
Longbourn.	1
There	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
question,	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
preceding	1
remark;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
look	1
and	1
a	1
manner	1
which	1
gave	1
them	1
meaning.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
often	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
turn	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
himself;	1
but,	1
whenever	1
she	1
did	1
catch	1
a	1
glimpse,	1
she	1
saw	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
general	1
complaisance,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
she	1
heard	1
an	1
accent	1
so	1
removed	1
from	1
_hauteur_	1
or	1
disdain	1
of	1
his	1
companions,	1
as	1
convinced	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
improvement	1
of	1
manners	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
yesterday	1
witnessed	1
however	1
temporary	1
its	1
existence	1
might	1
prove,	1
had	1
at	1
least	1
outlived	1
one	1
day.	1
When	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
thus	1
seeking	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
and	1
courting	1
the	1
good	1
opinion	1
of	1
people	1
with	1
whom	1
any	1
intercourse	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
ago	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
disgrace--when	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
thus	1
civil,	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
herself,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
relations	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
openly	1
disdained,	1
and	1
recollected	1
their	1
last	1
lively	1
scene	1
in	1
Hunsford	1
Parsonage--the	1
difference,	1
the	1
change	1
was	1
so	1
great,	1
and	1
struck	1
so	1
forcibly	1
on	1
her	1
mind,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
restrain	1
her	1
astonishment	1
from	1
being	1
visible.	1
Never,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
his	1
dear	1
friends	1
at	1
Netherfield,	1
or	1
his	1
dignified	1
relations	1
at	1
Rosings,	1
had	1
she	1
seen	1
him	1
so	1
desirous	1
to	1
please,	1
so	1
free	1
from	1
self-consequence	1
or	1
unbending	1
reserve,	1
as	1
now,	1
when	1
no	1
importance	1
could	1
result	1
from	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
his	1
endeavours,	1
and	1
when	1
even	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
his	1
attentions	1
were	1
addressed	1
would	1
draw	1
down	1
the	1
ridicule	1
and	1
censure	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
both	1
of	1
Netherfield	1
and	1
Rosings.	1
Their	1
visitors	1
stayed	1
with	1
them	1
above	1
half-an-hour;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
arose	1
to	1
depart,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
called	1
on	1
his	1
sister	1
to	1
join	1
him	1
in	1
expressing	1
their	1
wish	1
of	1
seeing	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
to	1
dinner	1
at	1
Pemberley,	1
before	1
they	1
left	1
the	1
country.	1
Miss	1
Darcy,	1
though	1
with	1
a	1
diffidence	1
which	1
marked	1
her	1
little	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
giving	1
invitations,	1
readily	1
obeyed.	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
niece,	1
desirous	1
of	1
knowing	1
how	1
_she_,	1
whom	1
the	1
invitation	1
most	1
concerned,	1
felt	1
disposed	1
as	1
to	1
its	1
acceptance,	1
but	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
turned	1
away	1
her	1
head.	1
Presuming	1
however,	1
that	1
this	1
studied	1
avoidance	1
spoke	1
rather	1
a	1
momentary	1
embarrassment	1
than	1
any	1
dislike	1
of	1
the	1
proposal,	1
and	1
seeing	1
in	1
her	1
husband,	1
who	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
society,	1
a	1
perfect	1
willingness	1
to	1
accept	1
it,	1
she	1
ventured	1
to	1
engage	1
for	1
her	1
attendance,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
the	1
next	1
was	1
fixed	1
on.	1
Bingley	1
expressed	1
great	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
certainty	1
of	1
seeing	1
Elizabeth	1
again,	1
having	1
still	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
many	1
inquiries	1
to	1
make	1
after	1
all	1
their	1
Hertfordshire	1
friends.	1
Elizabeth,	1
construing	1
all	1
this	1
into	1
a	1
wish	1
of	1
hearing	1
her	1
speak	1
of	1
her	1
sister,	1
was	1
pleased,	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
account,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
some	1
others,	1
found	1
herself,	1
when	1
their	1
visitors	1
left	1
them,	1
capable	1
of	1
considering	1
the	1
last	1
half-hour	1
with	1
some	1
satisfaction,	1
though	1
while	1
it	1
was	1
passing,	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
little.	1
Eager	1
to	1
be	1
alone,	1
and	1
fearful	1
of	1
inquiries	1
or	1
hints	1
from	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt,	1
she	1
stayed	1
with	1
them	1
only	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
hear	1
their	1
favourable	1
opinion	1
of	1
Bingley,	1
and	1
then	1
hurried	1
away	1
to	1
dress.	1
But	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
fear	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner's	1
curiosity;	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
their	1
wish	1
to	1
force	1
her	1
communication.	1
It	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
much	1
better	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
than	1
they	1
had	1
before	1
any	1
idea	1
of;	1
it	1
was	1
evident	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her.	1
They	1
saw	1
much	1
to	1
interest,	1
but	1
nothing	1
to	1
justify	1
inquiry.	1
Of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
anxiety	1
to	1
think	1
well;	1
and,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
their	1
acquaintance	1
reached,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
fault	1
to	1
find.	1
They	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
untouched	1
by	1
his	1
politeness;	1
and	1
had	1
they	1
drawn	1
his	1
character	1
from	1
their	1
own	1
feelings	1
and	1
his	1
servant's	1
report,	1
without	1
any	1
reference	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
account,	1
the	1
circle	1
in	1
Hertfordshire	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
known	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
recognized	1
it	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Darcy.	1
There	1
was	1
now	1
an	1
interest,	1
however,	1
in	1
believing	1
the	1
housekeeper;	1
and	1
they	1
soon	1
became	1
sensible	1
that	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
a	1
servant	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
him	1
since	1
he	1
was	1
four	1
years	1
old,	1
and	1
whose	1
own	1
manners	1
indicated	1
respectability,	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
hastily	1
rejected.	1
Neither	1
had	1
anything	1
occurred	1
in	1
the	1
intelligence	1
of	1
their	1
Lambton	1
friends	1
that	1
could	1
materially	1
lessen	1
its	1
weight.	1
They	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
accuse	1
him	1
of	1
but	1
pride;	1
pride	1
he	1
probably	1
had,	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
it	1
would	1
certainly	1
be	1
imputed	1
by	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
market-town	1
where	1
the	1
family	1
did	1
not	1
visit.	1
It	1
was	1
acknowledged,	1
however,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
liberal	1
man,	1
and	1
did	1
much	1
good	1
among	1
the	1
poor.	1
With	1
respect	1
to	1
Wickham,	1
the	1
travellers	1
soon	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
held	1
there	1
in	1
much	1
estimation;	1
for	1
though	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
his	1
concerns	1
with	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
patron	1
were	1
imperfectly	1
understood,	1
it	1
was	1
yet	1
a	1
well-known	1
fact	1
that,	1
on	1
his	1
quitting	1
Derbyshire,	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
many	1
debts	1
behind	1
him,	1
which	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
afterwards	1
discharged.	1
As	1
for	1
Elizabeth,	1
her	1
thoughts	1
were	1
at	1
Pemberley	1
this	1
evening	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
last;	1
and	1
the	1
evening,	1
though	1
as	1
it	1
passed	1
it	1
seemed	1
long,	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
enough	1
to	1
determine	1
her	1
feelings	1
towards	1
_one_	1
in	1
that	1
mansion;	1
and	1
she	1
lay	1
awake	1
two	1
whole	1
hours	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
out.	1
She	1
certainly	1
did	1
not	1
hate	1
him.	1
No;	1
hatred	1
had	1
vanished	1
long	1
ago,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
almost	1
as	1
long	1
been	1
ashamed	1
of	1
ever	1
feeling	1
a	1
dislike	1
against	1
him,	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
called.	1
The	1
respect	1
created	1
by	1
the	1
conviction	1
of	1
his	1
valuable	1
qualities,	1
though	1
at	1
first	1
unwillingly	1
admitted,	1
had	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
repugnant	1
to	1
her	1
feeling;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
heightened	1
into	1
somewhat	1
of	1
a	1
friendlier	1
nature,	1
by	1
the	1
testimony	1
so	1
highly	1
in	1
his	1
favour,	1
and	1
bringing	1
forward	1
his	1
disposition	1
in	1
so	1
amiable	1
a	1
light,	1
which	1
yesterday	1
had	1
produced.	1
But	1
above	1
all,	1
above	1
respect	1
and	1
esteem,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
motive	1
within	1
her	1
of	1
goodwill	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
overlooked.	1
It	1
was	1
gratitude;	1
gratitude,	1
not	1
merely	1
for	1
having	1
once	1
loved	1
her,	1
but	1
for	1
loving	1
her	1
still	1
well	1
enough	1
to	1
forgive	1
all	1
the	1
petulance	1
and	1
acrimony	1
of	1
her	1
manner	1
in	1
rejecting	1
him,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
unjust	1
accusations	1
accompanying	1
her	1
rejection.	1
He	1
who,	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
persuaded,	1
would	1
avoid	1
her	1
as	1
his	1
greatest	1
enemy,	1
seemed,	1
on	1
this	1
accidental	1
meeting,	1
most	1
eager	1
to	1
preserve	1
the	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
indelicate	1
display	1
of	1
regard,	1
or	1
any	1
peculiarity	1
of	1
manner,	1
where	1
their	1
two	1
selves	1
only	1
were	1
concerned,	1
was	1
soliciting	1
the	1
good	1
opinion	1
of	1
her	1
friends,	1
and	1
bent	1
on	1
making	1
her	1
known	1
to	1
his	1
sister.	1
Such	1
a	1
change	1
in	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
so	1
much	1
pride	1
exciting	1
not	1
only	1
astonishment	1
but	1
gratitude--for	1
to	1
love,	1
ardent	1
love,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
attributed;	1
and	1
as	1
such	1
its	1
impression	1
on	1
her	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
to	1
be	1
encouraged,	1
as	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
unpleasing,	1
though	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
exactly	1
defined.	1
She	1
respected,	1
she	1
esteemed,	1
she	1
was	1
grateful	1
to	1
him,	1
she	1
felt	1
a	1
real	1
interest	1
in	1
his	1
welfare;	1
and	1
she	1
only	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
far	1
she	1
wished	1
that	1
welfare	1
to	1
depend	1
upon	1
herself,	1
and	1
how	1
far	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
both	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
employ	1
the	1
power,	1
which	1
her	1
fancy	1
told	1
her	1
she	1
still	1
possessed,	1
of	1
bringing	1
on	1
her	1
the	1
renewal	1
of	1
his	1
addresses.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
settled	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
between	1
the	1
aunt	1
and	1
the	1
niece,	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
striking	1
civility	1
as	1
Miss	1
Darcy's	1
in	1
coming	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
of	1
her	1
arrival	1
at	1
Pemberley,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
reached	1
it	1
only	1
to	1
a	1
late	1
breakfast,	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
imitated,	1
though	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
equalled,	1
by	1
some	1
exertion	1
of	1
politeness	1
on	1
their	1
side;	1
and,	1
consequently,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
highly	1
expedient	1
to	1
wait	1
on	1
her	1
at	1
Pemberley	1
the	1
following	1
morning.	1
They	1
were,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
go.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
pleased;	1
though	1
when	1
she	1
asked	1
herself	1
the	1
reason,	1
she	1
had	1
very	1
little	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
reply.	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
left	1
them	1
soon	1
after	1
breakfast.	1
The	1
fishing	1
scheme	1
had	1
been	1
renewed	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
and	1
a	1
positive	1
engagement	1
made	1
of	1
his	1
meeting	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
at	1
Pemberley	1
before	1
noon.	1
Chapter	1
45	1
Convinced	1
as	1
Elizabeth	1
now	1
was	1
that	1
Miss	1
Bingley's	1
dislike	1
of	1
her	1
had	1
originated	1
in	1
jealousy,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
feeling	1
how	1
unwelcome	1
her	1
appearance	1
at	1
Pemberley	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
was	1
curious	1
to	1
know	1
with	1
how	1
much	1
civility	1
on	1
that	1
lady's	1
side	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
would	1
now	1
be	1
renewed.	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
house,	1
they	1
were	1
shown	1
through	1
the	1
hall	1
into	1
the	1
saloon,	1
whose	1
northern	1
aspect	1
rendered	1
it	1
delightful	1
for	1
summer.	1
Its	1
windows	1
opening	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
admitted	1
a	1
most	1
refreshing	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
woody	1
hills	1
behind	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
beautiful	1
oaks	1
and	1
Spanish	1
chestnuts	1
which	1
were	1
scattered	1
over	1
the	1
intermediate	1
lawn.	1
In	1
this	1
house	1
they	1
were	1
received	1
by	1
Miss	1
Darcy,	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
there	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bingley,	1
and	1
the	1
lady	1
with	1
whom	1
she	1
lived	1
in	1
London.	1
Georgiana's	1
reception	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
very	1
civil,	1
but	1
attended	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
embarrassment	1
which,	1
though	1
proceeding	1
from	1
shyness	1
and	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
doing	1
wrong,	1
would	1
easily	1
give	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
felt	1
themselves	1
inferior	1
the	1
belief	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
proud	1
and	1
reserved.	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
and	1
her	1
niece,	1
however,	1
did	1
her	1
justice,	1
and	1
pitied	1
her.	1
By	1
Mrs.	1
Hurst	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
they	1
were	1
noticed	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
curtsey;	1
and,	1
on	1
their	1
being	1
seated,	1
a	1
pause,	1
awkward	1
as	1
such	1
pauses	1
must	1
always	1
be,	1
succeeded	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
moments.	1
It	1
was	1
first	1
broken	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Annesley,	1
a	1
genteel,	1
agreeable-looking	1
woman,	1
whose	1
endeavour	1
to	1
introduce	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
discourse	1
proved	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
truly	1
well-bred	1
than	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
others;	1
and	1
between	1
her	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
with	1
occasional	1
help	1
from	1
Elizabeth,	1
the	1
conversation	1
was	1
carried	1
on.	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
wished	1
for	1
courage	1
enough	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
it;	1
and	1
sometimes	1
did	1
venture	1
a	1
short	1
sentence	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
least	1
danger	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
heard.	1
Elizabeth	1
soon	1
saw	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
herself	1
closely	1
watched	1
by	1
Miss	1
Bingley,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
a	1
word,	1
especially	1
to	1
Miss	1
Darcy,	1
without	1
calling	1
her	1
attention.	1
This	1
observation	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
prevented	1
her	1
from	1
trying	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
the	1
latter,	1
had	1
they	1
not	1
been	1
seated	1
at	1
an	1
inconvenient	1
distance;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
sorry	1
to	1
be	1
spared	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
saying	1
much.	1
Her	1
own	1
thoughts	1
were	1
employing	1
her.	1
She	1
expected	1
every	1
moment	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
would	1
enter	1
the	1
room.	1
She	1
wished,	1
she	1
feared	1
that	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
might	1
be	1
amongst	1
them;	1
and	1
whether	1
she	1
wished	1
or	1
feared	1
it	1
most,	1
she	1
could	1
scarcely	1
determine.	1
After	1
sitting	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour	1
without	1
hearing	1
Miss	1
Bingley's	1
voice,	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
roused	1
by	1
receiving	1
from	1
her	1
a	1
cold	1
inquiry	1
after	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
her	1
family.	1
She	1
answered	1
with	1
equal	1
indifference	1
and	1
brevity,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
said	1
no	1
more.	1
The	1
next	1
variation	1
which	1
their	1
visit	1
afforded	1
was	1
produced	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
servants	1
with	1
cold	1
meat,	1
cake,	1
and	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
finest	1
fruits	1
in	1
season;	1
but	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
place	1
till	1
after	1
many	1
a	1
significant	1
look	1
and	1
smile	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Annesley	1
to	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
had	1
been	1
given,	1
to	1
remind	1
her	1
of	1
her	1
post.	1
There	1
was	1
now	1
employment	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
party--for	1
though	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
all	1
talk,	1
they	1
could	1
all	1
eat;	1
and	1
the	1
beautiful	1
pyramids	1
of	1
grapes,	1
nectarines,	1
and	1
peaches	1
soon	1
collected	1
them	1
round	1
the	1
table.	1
While	1
thus	1
engaged,	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
a	1
fair	1
opportunity	1
of	1
deciding	1
whether	1
she	1
most	1
feared	1
or	1
wished	1
for	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
by	1
the	1
feelings	1
which	1
prevailed	1
on	1
his	1
entering	1
the	1
room;	1
and	1
then,	1
though	1
but	1
a	1
moment	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
believed	1
her	1
wishes	1
to	1
predominate,	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
regret	1
that	1
he	1
came.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
some	1
time	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner,	1
who,	1
with	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
other	1
gentlemen	1
from	1
the	1
house,	1
was	1
engaged	1
by	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
had	1
left	1
him	1
only	1
on	1
learning	1
that	1
the	1
ladies	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
intended	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
Georgiana	1
that	1
morning.	1
No	1
sooner	1
did	1
he	1
appear	1
than	1
Elizabeth	1
wisely	1
resolved	1
to	1
be	1
perfectly	1
easy	1
and	1
unembarrassed;	1
a	1
resolution	1
the	1
more	1
necessary	1
to	1
be	1
made,	1
but	1
perhaps	1
not	1
the	1
more	1
easily	1
kept,	1
because	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
suspicions	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
were	1
awakened	1
against	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
scarcely	1
an	1
eye	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
watch	1
his	1
behaviour	1
when	1
he	1
first	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
In	1
no	1
countenance	1
was	1
attentive	1
curiosity	1
so	1
strongly	1
marked	1
as	1
in	1
Miss	1
Bingley's,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
smiles	1
which	1
overspread	1
her	1
face	1
whenever	1
she	1
spoke	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
objects;	1
for	1
jealousy	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
made	1
her	1
desperate,	1
and	1
her	1
attentions	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
were	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
over.	1
Miss	1
Darcy,	1
on	1
her	1
brother's	1
entrance,	1
exerted	1
herself	1
much	1
more	1
to	1
talk,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
anxious	1
for	1
his	1
sister	1
and	1
herself	1
to	1
get	1
acquainted,	1
and	1
forwarded	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible,	1
every	1
attempt	1
at	1
conversation	1
on	1
either	1
side.	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
saw	1
all	1
this	1
likewise;	1
and,	1
in	1
the	1
imprudence	1
of	1
anger,	1
took	1
the	1
first	1
opportunity	1
of	1
saying,	1
with	1
sneering	1
civility:	1
"Pray,	1
Miss	1
Eliza,	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
----shire	1
Militia	1
removed	1
from	1
Meryton?	1
They	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
loss	1
to	1
_your_	1
family."	1
In	1
Darcy's	1
presence	1
she	1
dared	1
not	1
mention	1
Wickham's	1
name;	1
but	1
Elizabeth	1
instantly	1
comprehended	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
uppermost	1
in	1
her	1
thoughts;	1
and	1
the	1
various	1
recollections	1
connected	1
with	1
him	1
gave	1
her	1
a	1
moment's	1
distress;	1
but	1
exerting	1
herself	1
vigorously	1
to	1
repel	1
the	1
ill-natured	1
attack,	1
she	1
presently	1
answered	1
the	1
question	1
in	1
a	1
tolerably	1
detached	1
tone.	1
While	1
she	1
spoke,	1
an	1
involuntary	1
glance	1
showed	1
her	1
Darcy,	1
with	1
a	1
heightened	1
complexion,	1
earnestly	1
looking	1
at	1
her,	1
and	1
his	1
sister	1
overcome	1
with	1
confusion,	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
lift	1
up	1
her	1
eyes.	1
Had	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
known	1
what	1
pain	1
she	1
was	1
then	1
giving	1
her	1
beloved	1
friend,	1
she	1
undoubtedly	1
would	1
have	1
refrained	1
from	1
the	1
hint;	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
merely	1
intended	1
to	1
discompose	1
Elizabeth	1
by	1
bringing	1
forward	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
believed	1
her	1
partial,	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
betray	1
a	1
sensibility	1
which	1
might	1
injure	1
her	1
in	1
Darcy's	1
opinion,	1
and,	1
perhaps,	1
to	1
remind	1
the	1
latter	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
follies	1
and	1
absurdities	1
by	1
which	1
some	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
family	1
were	1
connected	1
with	1
that	1
corps.	1
Not	1
a	1
syllable	1
had	1
ever	1
reached	1
her	1
of	1
Miss	1
Darcy's	1
meditated	1
elopement.	1
To	1
no	1
creature	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
revealed,	1
where	1
secrecy	1
was	1
possible,	1
except	1
to	1
Elizabeth;	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
Bingley's	1
connections	1
her	1
brother	1
was	1
particularly	1
anxious	1
to	1
conceal	1
it,	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
wish	1
which	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
long	1
ago	1
attributed	1
to	1
him,	1
of	1
their	1
becoming	1
hereafter	1
her	1
own.	1
He	1
had	1
certainly	1
formed	1
such	1
a	1
plan,	1
and	1
without	1
meaning	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
effect	1
his	1
endeavour	1
to	1
separate	1
him	1
from	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
it	1
is	1
probable	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
add	1
something	1
to	1
his	1
lively	1
concern	1
for	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
his	1
friend.	1
Elizabeth's	1
collected	1
behaviour,	1
however,	1
soon	1
quieted	1
his	1
emotion;	1
and	1
as	1
Miss	1
Bingley,	1
vexed	1
and	1
disappointed,	1
dared	1
not	1
approach	1
nearer	1
to	1
Wickham,	1
Georgiana	1
also	1
recovered	1
in	1
time,	1
though	1
not	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
speak	1
any	1
more.	1
Her	1
brother,	1
whose	1
eye	1
she	1
feared	1
to	1
meet,	1
scarcely	1
recollected	1
her	1
interest	1
in	1
the	1
affair,	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
circumstance	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
designed	1
to	1
turn	1
his	1
thoughts	1
from	1
Elizabeth	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
fixed	1
them	1
on	1
her	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
cheerfully.	1
Their	1
visit	1
did	1
not	1
continue	1
long	1
after	1
the	1
question	1
and	1
answer	1
above	1
mentioned;	1
and	1
while	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
was	1
attending	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
carriage	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
was	1
venting	1
her	1
feelings	1
in	1
criticisms	1
on	1
Elizabeth's	1
person,	1
behaviour,	1
and	1
dress.	1
But	1
Georgiana	1
would	1
not	1
join	1
her.	1
Her	1
brother's	1
recommendation	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
ensure	1
her	1
favour;	1
his	1
judgement	1
could	1
not	1
err.	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
in	1
such	1
terms	1
of	1
Elizabeth	1
as	1
to	1
leave	1
Georgiana	1
without	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
finding	1
her	1
otherwise	1
than	1
lovely	1
and	1
amiable.	1
When	1
Darcy	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
saloon,	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
repeating	1
to	1
him	1
some	1
part	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
saying	1
to	1
his	1
sister.	1
"How	1
very	1
ill	1
Miss	1
Eliza	1
Bennet	1
looks	1
this	1
morning,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,"	1
she	1
cried;	1
"I	1
never	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
saw	1
anyone	1
so	1
much	1
altered	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
since	1
the	1
winter.	1
She	1
is	1
grown	1
so	1
brown	1
and	1
coarse!	1
Louisa	1
and	1
I	1
were	1
agreeing	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
known	1
her	1
again."	1
However	1
little	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
might	1
have	1
liked	1
such	1
an	1
address,	1
he	1
contented	1
himself	1
with	1
coolly	1
replying	1
that	1
he	1
perceived	1
no	1
other	1
alteration	1
than	1
her	1
being	1
rather	1
tanned,	1
no	1
miraculous	1
consequence	1
of	1
travelling	1
in	1
the	1
summer.	1
"For	1
my	1
own	1
part,"	1
she	1
rejoined,	1
"I	1
must	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
see	1
any	1
beauty	1
in	1
her.	1
Her	1
face	1
is	1
too	1
thin;	1
her	1
complexion	1
has	1
no	1
brilliancy;	1
and	1
her	1
features	1
are	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
handsome.	1
Her	1
nose	1
wants	1
character--there	1
is	1
nothing	1
marked	1
in	1
its	1
lines.	1
Her	1
teeth	1
are	1
tolerable,	1
but	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
way;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
her	1
eyes,	1
which	1
have	1
sometimes	1
been	1
called	1
so	1
fine,	1
I	1
could	1
never	1
see	1
anything	1
extraordinary	1
in	1
them.	1
They	1
have	1
a	1
sharp,	1
shrewish	1
look,	1
which	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
at	1
all;	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
air	1
altogether	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
self-sufficiency	1
without	1
fashion,	1
which	1
is	1
intolerable."	1
Persuaded	1
as	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
was	1
that	1
Darcy	1
admired	1
Elizabeth,	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
best	1
method	1
of	1
recommending	1
herself;	1
but	1
angry	1
people	1
are	1
not	1
always	1
wise;	1
and	1
in	1
seeing	1
him	1
at	1
last	1
look	1
somewhat	1
nettled,	1
she	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
success	1
she	1
expected.	1
He	1
was	1
resolutely	1
silent,	1
however,	1
and,	1
from	1
a	1
determination	1
of	1
making	1
him	1
speak,	1
she	1
continued:	1
"I	1
remember,	1
when	1
we	1
first	1
knew	1
her	1
in	1
Hertfordshire,	1
how	1
amazed	1
we	1
all	1
were	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
reputed	1
beauty;	1
and	1
I	1
particularly	1
recollect	1
your	1
saying	1
one	1
night,	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
dining	1
at	1
Netherfield,	1
'_She_	1
a	1
beauty!--I	1
should	1
as	1
soon	1
call	1
her	1
mother	1
a	1
wit.'	1
But	1
afterwards	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
improve	1
on	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
you	1
thought	1
her	1
rather	1
pretty	1
at	1
one	1
time."	1
"Yes,"	1
replied	1
Darcy,	1
who	1
could	1
contain	1
himself	1
no	1
longer,	1
"but	1
_that_	1
was	1
only	1
when	1
I	1
first	1
saw	1
her,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
many	1
months	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
considered	1
her	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
handsomest	1
women	1
of	1
my	1
acquaintance."	1
He	1
then	1
went	1
away,	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
having	1
forced	1
him	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
gave	1
no	1
one	1
any	1
pain	1
but	1
herself.	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
talked	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
occurred	1
during	1
their	1
visit,	1
as	1
they	1
returned,	1
except	1
what	1
had	1
particularly	1
interested	1
them	1
both.	1
The	1
look	1
and	1
behaviour	1
of	1
everybody	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
were	1
discussed,	1
except	1
of	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
had	1
mostly	1
engaged	1
their	1
attention.	1
They	1
talked	1
of	1
his	1
sister,	1
his	1
friends,	1
his	1
house,	1
his	1
fruit--of	1
everything	1
but	1
himself;	1
yet	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
longing	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
thought	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
highly	1
gratified	1
by	1
her	1
niece's	1
beginning	1
the	1
subject.	1
Chapter	1
46	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
disappointed	1
in	1
not	1
finding	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Jane	1
on	1
their	1
first	1
arrival	1
at	1
Lambton;	1
and	1
this	1
disappointment	1
had	1
been	1
renewed	1
on	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
mornings	1
that	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
spent	1
there;	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
her	1
repining	1
was	1
over,	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
justified,	1
by	1
the	1
receipt	1
of	1
two	1
letters	1
from	1
her	1
at	1
once,	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
marked	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
missent	1
elsewhere.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
not	1
surprised	1
at	1
it,	1
as	1
Jane	1
had	1
written	1
the	1
direction	1
remarkably	1
ill.	1
They	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
preparing	1
to	1
walk	1
as	1
the	1
letters	1
came	1
in;	1
and	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt,	1
leaving	1
her	1
to	1
enjoy	1
them	1
in	1
quiet,	1
set	1
off	1
by	1
themselves.	1
The	1
one	1
missent	1
must	1
first	1
be	1
attended	1
to;	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
written	1
five	1
days	1
ago.	1
The	1
beginning	1
contained	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
little	1
parties	1
and	1
engagements,	1
with	1
such	1
news	1
as	1
the	1
country	1
afforded;	1
but	1
the	1
latter	1
half,	1
which	1
was	1
dated	1
a	1
day	1
later,	1
and	1
written	1
in	1
evident	1
agitation,	1
gave	1
more	1
important	1
intelligence.	1
It	1
was	1
to	1
this	1
effect:	1
"Since	1
writing	1
the	1
above,	1
dearest	1
Lizzy,	1
something	1
has	1
occurred	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
unexpected	1
and	1
serious	1
nature;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
alarming	1
you--be	1
assured	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
well.	1
What	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
say	1
relates	1
to	1
poor	1
Lydia.	1
An	1
express	1
came	1
at	1
twelve	1
last	1
night,	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
gone	1
to	1
bed,	1
from	1
Colonel	1
Forster,	1
to	1
inform	1
us	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
gone	1
off	1
to	1
Scotland	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
officers;	1
to	1
own	1
the	1
truth,	1
with	1
Wickham!	1
Imagine	1
our	1
surprise.	1
To	1
Kitty,	1
however,	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
so	1
wholly	1
unexpected.	1
I	1
am	1
very,	1
very	1
sorry.	1
So	1
imprudent	1
a	1
match	1
on	1
both	1
sides!	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
willing	1
to	1
hope	1
the	1
best,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
character	1
has	1
been	1
misunderstood.	1
Thoughtless	1
and	1
indiscreet	1
I	1
can	1
easily	1
believe	1
him,	1
but	1
this	1
step	1
(and	1
let	1
us	1
rejoice	1
over	1
it)	1
marks	1
nothing	1
bad	1
at	1
heart.	1
His	1
choice	1
is	1
disinterested	1
at	1
least,	1
for	1
he	1
must	1
know	1
my	1
father	1
can	1
give	1
her	1
nothing.	1
Our	1
poor	1
mother	1
is	1
sadly	1
grieved.	1
My	1
father	1
bears	1
it	1
better.	1
How	1
thankful	1
am	1
I	1
that	1
we	1
never	1
let	1
them	1
know	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
against	1
him;	1
we	1
must	1
forget	1
it	1
ourselves.	1
They	1
were	1
off	1
Saturday	1
night	1
about	1
twelve,	1
as	1
is	1
conjectured,	1
but	1
were	1
not	1
missed	1
till	1
yesterday	1
morning	1
at	1
eight.	1
The	1
express	1
was	1
sent	1
off	1
directly.	1
My	1
dear	1
Lizzy,	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
passed	1
within	1
ten	1
miles	1
of	1
us.	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
gives	1
us	1
reason	1
to	1
expect	1
him	1
here	1
soon.	1
Lydia	1
left	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
for	1
his	1
wife,	1
informing	1
her	1
of	1
their	1
intention.	1
I	1
must	1
conclude,	1
for	1
I	1
cannot	1
be	1
long	1
from	1
my	1
poor	1
mother.	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
out,	1
but	1
I	1
hardly	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
written."	1
Without	1
allowing	1
herself	1
time	1
for	1
consideration,	1
and	1
scarcely	1
knowing	1
what	1
she	1
felt,	1
Elizabeth	1
on	1
finishing	1
this	1
letter	1
instantly	1
seized	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
opening	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
impatience,	1
read	1
as	1
follows:	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
written	1
a	1
day	1
later	1
than	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
the	1
first.	1
"By	1
this	1
time,	1
my	1
dearest	1
sister,	1
you	1
have	1
received	1
my	1
hurried	1
letter;	1
I	1
wish	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
more	1
intelligible,	1
but	1
though	1
not	1
confined	1
for	1
time,	1
my	1
head	1
is	1
so	1
bewildered	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
answer	1
for	1
being	1
coherent.	1
Dearest	1
Lizzy,	1
I	1
hardly	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
would	1
write,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
bad	1
news	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
delayed.	1
Imprudent	1
as	1
the	1
marriage	1
between	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
and	1
our	1
poor	1
Lydia	1
would	1
be,	1
we	1
are	1
now	1
anxious	1
to	1
be	1
assured	1
it	1
has	1
taken	1
place,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
too	1
much	1
reason	1
to	1
fear	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
gone	1
to	1
Scotland.	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
came	1
yesterday,	1
having	1
left	1
Brighton	1
the	1
day	1
before,	1
not	1
many	1
hours	1
after	1
the	1
express.	1
Though	1
Lydia's	1
short	1
letter	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
F.	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
Gretna	1
Green,	1
something	1
was	1
dropped	1
by	1
Denny	1
expressing	1
his	1
belief	1
that	1
W.	1
never	1
intended	1
to	1
go	1
there,	1
or	1
to	1
marry	1
Lydia	1
at	1
all,	1
which	1
was	1
repeated	1
to	1
Colonel	1
F.,	1
who,	1
instantly	1
taking	1
the	1
alarm,	1
set	1
off	1
from	1
B.	1
intending	1
to	1
trace	1
their	1
route.	1
He	1
did	1
trace	1
them	1
easily	1
to	1
Clapham,	1
but	1
no	1
further;	1
for	1
on	1
entering	1
that	1
place,	1
they	1
removed	1
into	1
a	1
hackney	1
coach,	1
and	1
dismissed	1
the	1
chaise	1
that	1
brought	1
them	1
from	1
Epsom.	1
All	1
that	1
is	1
known	1
after	1
this	1
is,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
seen	1
to	1
continue	1
the	1
London	1
road.	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
think.	1
After	1
making	1
every	1
possible	1
inquiry	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
London,	1
Colonel	1
F.	1
came	1
on	1
into	1
Hertfordshire,	1
anxiously	1
renewing	1
them	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
turnpikes,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
inns	1
in	1
Barnet	1
and	1
Hatfield,	1
but	1
without	1
any	1
success--no	1
such	1
people	1
had	1
been	1
seen	1
to	1
pass	1
through.	1
With	1
the	1
kindest	1
concern	1
he	1
came	1
on	1
to	1
Longbourn,	1
and	1
broke	1
his	1
apprehensions	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
most	1
creditable	1
to	1
his	1
heart.	1
I	1
am	1
sincerely	1
grieved	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
F.,	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
throw	1
any	1
blame	1
on	1
them.	1
Our	1
distress,	1
my	1
dear	1
Lizzy,	1
is	1
very	1
great.	1
My	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
believe	1
the	1
worst,	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
think	1
so	1
ill	1
of	1
him.	1
Many	1
circumstances	1
might	1
make	1
it	1
more	1
eligible	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
privately	1
in	1
town	1
than	1
to	1
pursue	1
their	1
first	1
plan;	1
and	1
even	1
if	1
_he_	1
could	1
form	1
such	1
a	1
design	1
against	1
a	1
young	1
woman	1
of	1
Lydia's	1
connections,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
likely,	1
can	1
I	1
suppose	1
her	1
so	1
lost	1
to	1
everything?	1
Impossible!	1
I	1
grieve	1
to	1
find,	1
however,	1
that	1
Colonel	1
F.	1
is	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
depend	1
upon	1
their	1
marriage;	1
he	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
when	1
I	1
expressed	1
my	1
hopes,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
feared	1
W.	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
trusted.	1
My	1
poor	1
mother	1
is	1
really	1
ill,	1
and	1
keeps	1
her	1
room.	1
Could	1
she	1
exert	1
herself,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better;	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
expected.	1
And	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
father,	1
I	1
never	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
saw	1
him	1
so	1
affected.	1
Poor	1
Kitty	1
has	1
anger	1
for	1
having	1
concealed	1
their	1
attachment;	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
confidence,	1
one	1
cannot	1
wonder.	1
I	1
am	1
truly	1
glad,	1
dearest	1
Lizzy,	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
spared	1
something	1
of	1
these	1
distressing	1
scenes;	1
but	1
now,	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
shock	1
is	1
over,	1
shall	1
I	1
own	1
that	1
I	1
long	1
for	1
your	1
return?	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
so	1
selfish,	1
however,	1
as	1
to	1
press	1
for	1
it,	1
if	1
inconvenient.	1
Adieu!	1
I	1
take	1
up	1
my	1
pen	1
again	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
told	1
you	1
I	1
would	1
not;	1
but	1
circumstances	1
are	1
such	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
earnestly	1
begging	1
you	1
all	1
to	1
come	1
here	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible.	1
I	1
know	1
my	1
dear	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
so	1
well,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
requesting	1
it,	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
still	1
something	1
more	1
to	1
ask	1
of	1
the	1
former.	1
My	1
father	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
London	1
with	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
instantly,	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
discover	1
her.	1
What	1
he	1
means	1
to	1
do	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
know	1
not;	1
but	1
his	1
excessive	1
distress	1
will	1
not	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
pursue	1
any	1
measure	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
safest	1
way,	1
and	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
is	1
obliged	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
Brighton	1
again	1
to-morrow	1
evening.	1
In	1
such	1
an	1
exigence,	1
my	1
uncle's	1
advice	1
and	1
assistance	1
would	1
be	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
he	1
will	1
immediately	1
comprehend	1
what	1
I	1
must	1
feel,	1
and	1
I	1
rely	1
upon	1
his	1
goodness."	1
"Oh!	1
where,	1
where	1
is	1
my	1
uncle?"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth,	1
darting	1
from	1
her	1
seat	1
as	1
she	1
finished	1
the	1
letter,	1
in	1
eagerness	1
to	1
follow	1
him,	1
without	1
losing	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
so	1
precious;	1
but	1
as	1
she	1
reached	1
the	1
door	1
it	1
was	1
opened	1
by	1
a	1
servant,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
appeared.	1
Her	1
pale	1
face	1
and	1
impetuous	1
manner	1
made	1
him	1
start,	1
and	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
recover	1
himself	1
to	1
speak,	1
she,	1
in	1
whose	1
mind	1
every	1
idea	1
was	1
superseded	1
by	1
Lydia's	1
situation,	1
hastily	1
exclaimed,	1
"I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
leave	1
you.	1
I	1
must	1
find	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
this	1
moment,	1
on	1
business	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
delayed;	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
an	1
instant	1
to	1
lose."	1
"Good	1
God!	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter?"	1
cried	1
he,	1
with	1
more	1
feeling	1
than	1
politeness;	1
then	1
recollecting	1
himself,	1
"I	1
will	1
not	1
detain	1
you	1
a	1
minute;	1
but	1
let	1
me,	1
or	1
let	1
the	1
servant	1
go	1
after	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner.	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
well	1
enough;	1
you	1
cannot	1
go	1
yourself."	1
Elizabeth	1
hesitated,	1
but	1
her	1
knees	1
trembled	1
under	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
felt	1
how	1
little	1
would	1
be	1
gained	1
by	1
her	1
attempting	1
to	1
pursue	1
them.	1
Calling	1
back	1
the	1
servant,	1
therefore,	1
she	1
commissioned	1
him,	1
though	1
in	1
so	1
breathless	1
an	1
accent	1
as	1
made	1
her	1
almost	1
unintelligible,	1
to	1
fetch	1
his	1
master	1
and	1
mistress	1
home	1
instantly.	1
On	1
his	1
quitting	1
the	1
room	1
she	1
sat	1
down,	1
unable	1
to	1
support	1
herself,	1
and	1
looking	1
so	1
miserably	1
ill,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
Darcy	1
to	1
leave	1
her,	1
or	1
to	1
refrain	1
from	1
saying,	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
gentleness	1
and	1
commiseration,	1
"Let	1
me	1
call	1
your	1
maid.	1
Is	1
there	1
nothing	1
you	1
could	1
take	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
present	1
relief?	1
A	1
glass	1
of	1
wine;	1
shall	1
I	1
get	1
you	1
one?	1
You	1
are	1
very	1
ill."	1
"No,	1
I	1
thank	1
you,"	1
she	1
replied,	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
recover	1
herself.	1
"There	1
is	1
nothing	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
me.	1
I	1
am	1
quite	1
well;	1
I	1
am	1
only	1
distressed	1
by	1
some	1
dreadful	1
news	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
received	1
from	1
Longbourn."	1
She	1
burst	1
into	1
tears	1
as	1
she	1
alluded	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
another	1
word.	1
Darcy,	1
in	1
wretched	1
suspense,	1
could	1
only	1
say	1
something	1
indistinctly	1
of	1
his	1
concern,	1
and	1
observe	1
her	1
in	1
compassionate	1
silence.	1
At	1
length	1
she	1
spoke	1
again.	1
"I	1
have	1
just	1
had	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Jane,	1
with	1
such	1
dreadful	1
news.	1
It	1
cannot	1
be	1
concealed	1
from	1
anyone.	1
My	1
younger	1
sister	1
has	1
left	1
all	1
her	1
friends--has	1
eloped;	1
has	1
thrown	1
herself	1
into	1
the	1
power	1
of--of	1
Mr.	1
Wickham.	1
They	1
are	1
gone	1
off	1
together	1
from	1
Brighton.	1
_You_	1
know	1
him	1
too	1
well	1
to	1
doubt	1
the	1
rest.	1
She	1
has	1
no	1
money,	1
no	1
connections,	1
nothing	1
that	1
can	1
tempt	1
him	1
to--she	1
is	1
lost	1
for	1
ever."	1
Darcy	1
was	1
fixed	1
in	1
astonishment.	1
"When	1
I	1
consider,"	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
yet	1
more	1
agitated	1
voice,	1
"that	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
prevented	1
it!	1
I,	1
who	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
was.	1
Had	1
I	1
but	1
explained	1
some	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
only--some	1
part	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
learnt,	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
family!	1
Had	1
his	1
character	1
been	1
known,	1
this	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
happened.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
all--all	1
too	1
late	1
now."	1
"I	1
am	1
grieved	1
indeed,"	1
cried	1
Darcy;	1
"grieved--shocked.	1
But	1
is	1
it	1
certain--absolutely	1
certain?"	1
"Oh,	1
yes!	1
They	1
left	1
Brighton	1
together	1
on	1
Sunday	1
night,	1
and	1
were	1
traced	1
almost	1
to	1
London,	1
but	1
not	1
beyond;	1
they	1
are	1
certainly	1
not	1
gone	1
to	1
Scotland."	1
"And	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
done,	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
attempted,	1
to	1
recover	1
her?"	1
"My	1
father	1
is	1
gone	1
to	1
London,	1
and	1
Jane	1
has	1
written	1
to	1
beg	1
my	1
uncle's	1
immediate	1
assistance;	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
off,	1
I	1
hope,	1
in	1
half-an-hour.	1
But	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
done--I	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
done.	1
How	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
worked	1
on?	1
How	1
are	1
they	1
even	1
to	1
be	1
discovered?	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
hope.	1
It	1
is	1
every	1
way	1
horrible!"	1
Darcy	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
silent	1
acquiescence.	1
"When	1
_my_	1
eyes	1
were	1
opened	1
to	1
his	1
real	1
character--Oh!	1
had	1
I	1
known	1
what	1
I	1
ought,	1
what	1
I	1
dared	1
to	1
do!	1
But	1
I	1
knew	1
not--I	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
doing	1
too	1
much.	1
Wretched,	1
wretched	1
mistake!"	1
Darcy	1
made	1
no	1
answer.	1
He	1
seemed	1
scarcely	1
to	1
hear	1
her,	1
and	1
was	1
walking	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
earnest	1
meditation,	1
his	1
brow	1
contracted,	1
his	1
air	1
gloomy.	1
Elizabeth	1
soon	1
observed,	1
and	1
instantly	1
understood	1
it.	1
Her	1
power	1
was	1
sinking;	1
everything	1
_must_	1
sink	1
under	1
such	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
family	1
weakness,	1
such	1
an	1
assurance	1
of	1
the	1
deepest	1
disgrace.	1
She	1
could	1
neither	1
wonder	1
nor	1
condemn,	1
but	1
the	1
belief	1
of	1
his	1
self-conquest	1
brought	1
nothing	1
consolatory	1
to	1
her	1
bosom,	1
afforded	1
no	1
palliation	1
of	1
her	1
distress.	1
It	1
was,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
exactly	1
calculated	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
understand	1
her	1
own	1
wishes;	1
and	1
never	1
had	1
she	1
so	1
honestly	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
loved	1
him,	1
as	1
now,	1
when	1
all	1
love	1
must	1
be	1
vain.	1
But	1
self,	1
though	1
it	1
would	1
intrude,	1
could	1
not	1
engross	1
her.	1
Lydia--the	1
humiliation,	1
the	1
misery	1
she	1
was	1
bringing	1
on	1
them	1
all,	1
soon	1
swallowed	1
up	1
every	1
private	1
care;	1
and	1
covering	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
her	1
handkerchief,	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
soon	1
lost	1
to	1
everything	1
else;	1
and,	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
of	1
several	1
minutes,	1
was	1
only	1
recalled	1
to	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
her	1
situation	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
her	1
companion,	1
who,	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
which,	1
though	1
it	1
spoke	1
compassion,	1
spoke	1
likewise	1
restraint,	1
said,	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
long	1
desiring	1
my	1
absence,	1
nor	1
have	1
I	1
anything	1
to	1
plead	1
in	1
excuse	1
of	1
my	1
stay,	1
but	1
real,	1
though	1
unavailing	1
concern.	1
Would	1
to	1
Heaven	1
that	1
anything	1
could	1
be	1
either	1
said	1
or	1
done	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
that	1
might	1
offer	1
consolation	1
to	1
such	1
distress!	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
torment	1
you	1
with	1
vain	1
wishes,	1
which	1
may	1
seem	1
purposely	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
your	1
thanks.	1
This	1
unfortunate	1
affair	1
will,	1
I	1
fear,	1
prevent	1
my	1
sister's	1
having	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
seeing	1
you	1
at	1
Pemberley	1
to-day."	1
"Oh,	1
yes.	1
Be	1
so	1
kind	1
as	1
to	1
apologise	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
Miss	1
Darcy.	1
Say	1
that	1
urgent	1
business	1
calls	1
us	1
home	1
immediately.	1
Conceal	1
the	1
unhappy	1
truth	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
possible,	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
long."	1
He	1
readily	1
assured	1
her	1
of	1
his	1
secrecy;	1
again	1
expressed	1
his	1
sorrow	1
for	1
her	1
distress,	1
wished	1
it	1
a	1
happier	1
conclusion	1
than	1
there	1
was	1
at	1
present	1
reason	1
to	1
hope,	1
and	1
leaving	1
his	1
compliments	1
for	1
her	1
relations,	1
with	1
only	1
one	1
serious,	1
parting	1
look,	1
went	1
away.	1
As	1
he	1
quitted	1
the	1
room,	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
how	1
improbable	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
ever	1
see	1
each	1
other	1
again	1
on	1
such	1
terms	1
of	1
cordiality	1
as	1
had	1
marked	1
their	1
several	1
meetings	1
in	1
Derbyshire;	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
threw	1
a	1
retrospective	1
glance	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
their	1
acquaintance,	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
contradictions	1
and	1
varieties,	1
sighed	1
at	1
the	1
perverseness	1
of	1
those	1
feelings	1
which	1
would	1
now	1
have	1
promoted	1
its	1
continuance,	1
and	1
would	1
formerly	1
have	1
rejoiced	1
in	1
its	1
termination.	1
If	1
gratitude	1
and	1
esteem	1
are	1
good	1
foundations	1
of	1
affection,	1
Elizabeth's	1
change	1
of	1
sentiment	1
will	1
be	1
neither	1
improbable	1
nor	1
faulty.	1
But	1
if	1
otherwise--if	1
regard	1
springing	1
from	1
such	1
sources	1
is	1
unreasonable	1
or	1
unnatural,	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
so	1
often	1
described	1
as	1
arising	1
on	1
a	1
first	1
interview	1
with	1
its	1
object,	1
and	1
even	1
before	1
two	1
words	1
have	1
been	1
exchanged,	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
said	1
in	1
her	1
defence,	1
except	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
given	1
somewhat	1
of	1
a	1
trial	1
to	1
the	1
latter	1
method	1
in	1
her	1
partiality	1
for	1
Wickham,	1
and	1
that	1
its	1
ill	1
success	1
might,	1
perhaps,	1
authorise	1
her	1
to	1
seek	1
the	1
other	1
less	1
interesting	1
mode	1
of	1
attachment.	1
Be	1
that	1
as	1
it	1
may,	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
go	1
with	1
regret;	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
early	1
example	1
of	1
what	1
Lydia's	1
infamy	1
must	1
produce,	1
found	1
additional	1
anguish	1
as	1
she	1
reflected	1
on	1
that	1
wretched	1
business.	1
Never,	1
since	1
reading	1
Jane's	1
second	1
letter,	1
had	1
she	1
entertained	1
a	1
hope	1
of	1
Wickham's	1
meaning	1
to	1
marry	1
her.	1
No	1
one	1
but	1
Jane,	1
she	1
thought,	1
could	1
flatter	1
herself	1
with	1
such	1
an	1
expectation.	1
Surprise	1
was	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
her	1
feelings	1
on	1
this	1
development.	1
While	1
the	1
contents	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
letter	1
remained	1
in	1
her	1
mind,	1
she	1
was	1
all	1
surprise--all	1
astonishment	1
that	1
Wickham	1
should	1
marry	1
a	1
girl	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
he	1
could	1
marry	1
for	1
money;	1
and	1
how	1
Lydia	1
could	1
ever	1
have	1
attached	1
him	1
had	1
appeared	1
incomprehensible.	1
But	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
too	1
natural.	1
For	1
such	1
an	1
attachment	1
as	1
this	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
sufficient	1
charms;	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
suppose	1
Lydia	1
to	1
be	1
deliberately	1
engaging	1
in	1
an	1
elopement	1
without	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
marriage,	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
believing	1
that	1
neither	1
her	1
virtue	1
nor	1
her	1
understanding	1
would	1
preserve	1
her	1
from	1
falling	1
an	1
easy	1
prey.	1
She	1
had	1
never	1
perceived,	1
while	1
the	1
regiment	1
was	1
in	1
Hertfordshire,	1
that	1
Lydia	1
had	1
any	1
partiality	1
for	1
him;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
Lydia	1
wanted	1
only	1
encouragement	1
to	1
attach	1
herself	1
to	1
anybody.	1
Sometimes	1
one	1
officer,	1
sometimes	1
another,	1
had	1
been	1
her	1
favourite,	1
as	1
their	1
attentions	1
raised	1
them	1
in	1
her	1
opinion.	1
Her	1
affections	1
had	1
continually	1
been	1
fluctuating	1
but	1
never	1
without	1
an	1
object.	1
The	1
mischief	1
of	1
neglect	1
and	1
mistaken	1
indulgence	1
towards	1
such	1
a	1
girl--oh!	1
how	1
acutely	1
did	1
she	1
now	1
feel	1
it!	1
She	1
was	1
wild	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
home--to	1
hear,	1
to	1
see,	1
to	1
be	1
upon	1
the	1
spot	1
to	1
share	1
with	1
Jane	1
in	1
the	1
cares	1
that	1
must	1
now	1
fall	1
wholly	1
upon	1
her,	1
in	1
a	1
family	1
so	1
deranged,	1
a	1
father	1
absent,	1
a	1
mother	1
incapable	1
of	1
exertion,	1
and	1
requiring	1
constant	1
attendance;	1
and	1
though	1
almost	1
persuaded	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
Lydia,	1
her	1
uncle's	1
interference	1
seemed	1
of	1
the	1
utmost	1
importance,	1
and	1
till	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
her	1
impatience	1
was	1
severe.	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
had	1
hurried	1
back	1
in	1
alarm,	1
supposing	1
by	1
the	1
servant's	1
account	1
that	1
their	1
niece	1
was	1
taken	1
suddenly	1
ill;	1
but	1
satisfying	1
them	1
instantly	1
on	1
that	1
head,	1
she	1
eagerly	1
communicated	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
their	1
summons,	1
reading	1
the	1
two	1
letters	1
aloud,	1
and	1
dwelling	1
on	1
the	1
postscript	1
of	1
the	1
last	1
with	1
trembling	1
energy,	1
though	1
Lydia	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
a	1
favourite	1
with	1
them,	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
be	1
deeply	1
afflicted.	1
Not	1
Lydia	1
only,	1
but	1
all	1
were	1
concerned	1
in	1
it;	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
first	1
exclamations	1
of	1
surprise	1
and	1
horror,	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
promised	1
every	1
assistance	1
in	1
his	1
power.	1
Elizabeth,	1
though	1
expecting	1
no	1
less,	1
thanked	1
him	1
with	1
tears	1
of	1
gratitude;	1
and	1
all	1
three	1
being	1
actuated	1
by	1
one	1
spirit,	1
everything	1
relating	1
to	1
their	1
journey	1
was	1
speedily	1
settled.	1
They	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
off	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible.	1
"But	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
about	1
Pemberley?"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner.	1
"John	1
told	1
us	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
was	1
here	1
when	1
you	1
sent	1
for	1
us;	1
was	1
it	1
so?"	1
"Yes;	1
and	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
our	1
engagement.	1
_That_	1
is	1
all	1
settled."	1
"What	1
is	1
all	1
settled?"	1
repeated	1
the	1
other,	1
as	1
she	1
ran	1
into	1
her	1
room	1
to	1
prepare.	1
"And	1
are	1
they	1
upon	1
such	1
terms	1
as	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
disclose	1
the	1
real	1
truth?	1
Oh,	1
that	1
I	1
knew	1
how	1
it	1
was!"	1
But	1
wishes	1
were	1
vain,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
could	1
only	1
serve	1
to	1
amuse	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
hurry	1
and	1
confusion	1
of	1
the	1
following	1
hour.	1
Had	1
Elizabeth	1
been	1
at	1
leisure	1
to	1
be	1
idle,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
remained	1
certain	1
that	1
all	1
employment	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
one	1
so	1
wretched	1
as	1
herself;	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
her	1
share	1
of	1
business	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
her	1
aunt,	1
and	1
amongst	1
the	1
rest	1
there	1
were	1
notes	1
to	1
be	1
written	1
to	1
all	1
their	1
friends	1
at	1
Lambton,	1
with	1
false	1
excuses	1
for	1
their	1
sudden	1
departure.	1
An	1
hour,	1
however,	1
saw	1
the	1
whole	1
completed;	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
meanwhile	1
having	1
settled	1
his	1
account	1
at	1
the	1
inn,	1
nothing	1
remained	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
but	1
to	1
go;	1
and	1
Elizabeth,	1
after	1
all	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
found	1
herself,	1
in	1
a	1
shorter	1
space	1
of	1
time	1
than	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
supposed,	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
carriage,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Longbourn.	1
Chapter	1
47	1
"I	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
it	1
over	1
again,	1
Elizabeth,"	1
said	1
her	1
uncle,	1
as	1
they	1
drove	1
from	1
the	1
town;	1
"and	1
really,	1
upon	1
serious	1
consideration,	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
more	1
inclined	1
than	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
judge	1
as	1
your	1
eldest	1
sister	1
does	1
on	1
the	1
matter.	1
It	1
appears	1
to	1
me	1
so	1
very	1
unlikely	1
that	1
any	1
young	1
man	1
should	1
form	1
such	1
a	1
design	1
against	1
a	1
girl	1
who	1
is	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
unprotected	1
or	1
friendless,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
actually	1
staying	1
in	1
his	1
colonel's	1
family,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
strongly	1
inclined	1
to	1
hope	1
the	1
best.	1
Could	1
he	1
expect	1
that	1
her	1
friends	1
would	1
not	1
step	1
forward?	1
Could	1
he	1
expect	1
to	1
be	1
noticed	1
again	1
by	1
the	1
regiment,	1
after	1
such	1
an	1
affront	1
to	1
Colonel	1
Forster?	1
His	1
temptation	1
is	1
not	1
adequate	1
to	1
the	1
risk!"	1
"Do	1
you	1
really	1
think	1
so?"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth,	1
brightening	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
"Upon	1
my	1
word,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
"I	1
begin	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
your	1
uncle's	1
opinion.	1
It	1
is	1
really	1
too	1
great	1
a	1
violation	1
of	1
decency,	1
honour,	1
and	1
interest,	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
guilty	1
of.	1
I	1
cannot	1
think	1
so	1
very	1
ill	1
of	1
Wickham.	1
Can	1
you	1
yourself,	1
Lizzy,	1
so	1
wholly	1
give	1
him	1
up,	1
as	1
to	1
believe	1
him	1
capable	1
of	1
it?"	1
"Not,	1
perhaps,	1
of	1
neglecting	1
his	1
own	1
interest;	1
but	1
of	1
every	1
other	1
neglect	1
I	1
can	1
believe	1
him	1
capable.	1
If,	1
indeed,	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
so!	1
But	1
I	1
dare	1
not	1
hope	1
it.	1
Why	1
should	1
they	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
Scotland	1
if	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
case?"	1
"In	1
the	1
first	1
place,"	1
replied	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner,	1
"there	1
is	1
no	1
absolute	1
proof	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
gone	1
to	1
Scotland."	1
"Oh!	1
but	1
their	1
removing	1
from	1
the	1
chaise	1
into	1
a	1
hackney	1
coach	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
presumption!	1
And,	1
besides,	1
no	1
traces	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
on	1
the	1
Barnet	1
road."	1
"Well,	1
then--supposing	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
London.	1
They	1
may	1
be	1
there,	1
though	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
concealment,	1
for	1
no	1
more	1
exceptional	1
purpose.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
likely	1
that	1
money	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
abundant	1
on	1
either	1
side;	1
and	1
it	1
might	1
strike	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
economically,	1
though	1
less	1
expeditiously,	1
married	1
in	1
London	1
than	1
in	1
Scotland."	1
"But	1
why	1
all	1
this	1
secrecy?	1
Why	1
any	1
fear	1
of	1
detection?	1
Why	1
must	1
their	1
marriage	1
be	1
private?	1
Oh,	1
no,	1
no--this	1
is	1
not	1
likely.	1
His	1
most	1
particular	1
friend,	1
you	1
see	1
by	1
Jane's	1
account,	1
was	1
persuaded	1
of	1
his	1
never	1
intending	1
to	1
marry	1
her.	1
Wickham	1
will	1
never	1
marry	1
a	1
woman	1
without	1
some	1
money.	1
He	1
cannot	1
afford	1
it.	1
And	1
what	1
claims	1
has	1
Lydia--what	1
attraction	1
has	1
she	1
beyond	1
youth,	1
health,	1
and	1
good	1
humour	1
that	1
could	1
make	1
him,	1
for	1
her	1
sake,	1
forego	1
every	1
chance	1
of	1
benefiting	1
himself	1
by	1
marrying	1
well?	1
As	1
to	1
what	1
restraint	1
the	1
apprehensions	1
of	1
disgrace	1
in	1
the	1
corps	1
might	1
throw	1
on	1
a	1
dishonourable	1
elopement	1
with	1
her,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
judge;	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
effects	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
step	1
might	1
produce.	1
But	1
as	1
to	1
your	1
other	1
objection,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
it	1
will	1
hardly	1
hold	1
good.	1
Lydia	1
has	1
no	1
brothers	1
to	1
step	1
forward;	1
and	1
he	1
might	1
imagine,	1
from	1
my	1
father's	1
behaviour,	1
from	1
his	1
indolence	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
attention	1
he	1
has	1
ever	1
seemed	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
forward	1
in	1
his	1
family,	1
that	1
_he_	1
would	1
do	1
as	1
little,	1
and	1
think	1
as	1
little	1
about	1
it,	1
as	1
any	1
father	1
could	1
do,	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
matter."	1
"But	1
can	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
Lydia	1
is	1
so	1
lost	1
to	1
everything	1
but	1
love	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
consent	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
him	1
on	1
any	1
terms	1
other	1
than	1
marriage?"	1
"It	1
does	1
seem,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
most	1
shocking	1
indeed,"	1
replied	1
Elizabeth,	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
eyes,	1
"that	1
a	1
sister's	1
sense	1
of	1
decency	1
and	1
virtue	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
point	1
should	1
admit	1
of	1
doubt.	1
But,	1
really,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
say.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
doing	1
her	1
justice.	1
But	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
young;	1
she	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
taught	1
to	1
think	1
on	1
serious	1
subjects;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
half-year,	1
nay,	1
for	1
a	1
twelvemonth--she	1
has	1
been	1
given	1
up	1
to	1
nothing	1
but	1
amusement	1
and	1
vanity.	1
She	1
has	1
been	1
allowed	1
to	1
dispose	1
of	1
her	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
idle	1
and	1
frivolous	1
manner,	1
and	1
to	1
adopt	1
any	1
opinions	1
that	1
came	1
in	1
her	1
way.	1
Since	1
the	1
----shire	1
were	1
first	1
quartered	1
in	1
Meryton,	1
nothing	1
but	1
love,	1
flirtation,	1
and	1
officers	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
her	1
head.	1
She	1
has	1
been	1
doing	1
everything	1
in	1
her	1
power	1
by	1
thinking	1
and	1
talking	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
to	1
give	1
greater--what	1
shall	1
I	1
call	1
it?	1
susceptibility	1
to	1
her	1
feelings;	1
which	1
are	1
naturally	1
lively	1
enough.	1
And	1
we	1
all	1
know	1
that	1
Wickham	1
has	1
every	1
charm	1
of	1
person	1
and	1
address	1
that	1
can	1
captivate	1
a	1
woman."	1
"But	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
Jane,"	1
said	1
her	1
aunt,	1
"does	1
not	1
think	1
so	1
very	1
ill	1
of	1
Wickham	1
as	1
to	1
believe	1
him	1
capable	1
of	1
the	1
attempt."	1
"Of	1
whom	1
does	1
Jane	1
ever	1
think	1
ill?	1
And	1
who	1
is	1
there,	1
whatever	1
might	1
be	1
their	1
former	1
conduct,	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
think	1
capable	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
attempt,	1
till	1
it	1
were	1
proved	1
against	1
them?	1
But	1
Jane	1
knows,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do,	1
what	1
Wickham	1
really	1
is.	1
We	1
both	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
profligate	1
in	1
every	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
word;	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
neither	1
integrity	1
nor	1
honour;	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
as	1
false	1
and	1
deceitful	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
insinuating."	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
really	1
know	1
all	1
this?"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
whose	1
curiosity	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
mode	1
of	1
her	1
intelligence	1
was	1
all	1
alive.	1
"I	1
do	1
indeed,"	1
replied	1
Elizabeth,	1
colouring.	1
"I	1
told	1
you,	1
the	1
other	1
day,	1
of	1
his	1
infamous	1
behaviour	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Darcy;	1
and	1
you	1
yourself,	1
when	1
last	1
at	1
Longbourn,	1
heard	1
in	1
what	1
manner	1
he	1
spoke	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
behaved	1
with	1
such	1
forbearance	1
and	1
liberality	1
towards	1
him.	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
circumstances	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
at	1
liberty--which	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
worth	1
while	1
to	1
relate;	1
but	1
his	1
lies	1
about	1
the	1
whole	1
Pemberley	1
family	1
are	1
endless.	1
From	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
of	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
I	1
was	1
thoroughly	1
prepared	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
proud,	1
reserved,	1
disagreeable	1
girl.	1
Yet	1
he	1
knew	1
to	1
the	1
contrary	1
himself.	1
He	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
amiable	1
and	1
unpretending	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
her."	1
"But	1
does	1
Lydia	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
this?	1
can	1
she	1
be	1
ignorant	1
of	1
what	1
you	1
and	1
Jane	1
seem	1
so	1
well	1
to	1
understand?"	1
"Oh,	1
yes!--that,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
all.	1
Till	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
Kent,	1
and	1
saw	1
so	1
much	1
both	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
and	1
his	1
relation	1
Colonel	1
Fitzwilliam,	1
I	1
was	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
myself.	1
And	1
when	1
I	1
returned	1
home,	1
the	1
----shire	1
was	1
to	1
leave	1
Meryton	1
in	1
a	1
week	1
or	1
fortnight's	1
time.	1
As	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
case,	1
neither	1
Jane,	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
related	1
the	1
whole,	1
nor	1
I,	1
thought	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
make	1
our	1
knowledge	1
public;	1
for	1
of	1
what	1
use	1
could	1
it	1
apparently	1
be	1
to	1
any	1
one,	1
that	1
the	1
good	1
opinion	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
had	1
of	1
him	1
should	1
then	1
be	1
overthrown?	1
And	1
even	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
settled	1
that	1
Lydia	1
should	1
go	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Forster,	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
opening	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
his	1
character	1
never	1
occurred	1
to	1
me.	1
That	1
_she_	1
could	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
danger	1
from	1
the	1
deception	1
never	1
entered	1
my	1
head.	1
That	1
such	1
a	1
consequence	1
as	1
_this_	1
could	1
ensue,	1
you	1
may	1
easily	1
believe,	1
was	1
far	1
enough	1
from	1
my	1
thoughts."	1
"When	1
they	1
all	1
removed	1
to	1
Brighton,	1
therefore,	1
you	1
had	1
no	1
reason,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
to	1
believe	1
them	1
fond	1
of	1
each	1
other?"	1
"Not	1
the	1
slightest.	1
I	1
can	1
remember	1
no	1
symptom	1
of	1
affection	1
on	1
either	1
side;	1
and	1
had	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
been	1
perceptible,	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
aware	1
that	1
ours	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
family	1
on	1
which	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
thrown	1
away.	1
When	1
first	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
corps,	1
she	1
was	1
ready	1
enough	1
to	1
admire	1
him;	1
but	1
so	1
we	1
all	1
were.	1
Every	1
girl	1
in	1
or	1
near	1
Meryton	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
senses	1
about	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
two	1
months;	1
but	1
he	1
never	1
distinguished	1
_her_	1
by	1
any	1
particular	1
attention;	1
and,	1
consequently,	1
after	1
a	1
moderate	1
period	1
of	1
extravagant	1
and	1
wild	1
admiration,	1
her	1
fancy	1
for	1
him	1
gave	1
way,	1
and	1
others	1
of	1
the	1
regiment,	1
who	1
treated	1
her	1
with	1
more	1
distinction,	1
again	1
became	1
her	1
favourites."	1

It	1
may	1
be	1
easily	1
believed,	1
that	1
however	1
little	1
of	1
novelty	1
could	1
be	1
added	1
to	1
their	1
fears,	1
hopes,	1
and	1
conjectures,	1
on	1
this	1
interesting	1
subject,	1
by	1
its	1
repeated	1
discussion,	1
no	1
other	1
could	1
detain	1
them	1
from	1
it	1
long,	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
journey.	1
From	1
Elizabeth's	1
thoughts	1
it	1
was	1
never	1
absent.	1
Fixed	1
there	1
by	1
the	1
keenest	1
of	1
all	1
anguish,	1
self-reproach,	1
she	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
interval	1
of	1
ease	1
or	1
forgetfulness.	1
They	1
travelled	1
as	1
expeditiously	1
as	1
possible,	1
and,	1
sleeping	1
one	1
night	1
on	1
the	1
road,	1
reached	1
Longbourn	1
by	1
dinner	1
time	1
the	1
next	1
day.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
comfort	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
to	1
consider	1
that	1
Jane	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
wearied	1
by	1
long	1
expectations.	1
The	1
little	1
Gardiners,	1
attracted	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
a	1
chaise,	1
were	1
standing	1
on	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
paddock;	1
and,	1
when	1
the	1
carriage	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
the	1
joyful	1
surprise	1
that	1
lighted	1
up	1
their	1
faces,	1
and	1
displayed	1
itself	1
over	1
their	1
whole	1
bodies,	1
in	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
capers	1
and	1
frisks,	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
pleasing	1
earnest	1
of	1
their	1
welcome.	1
Elizabeth	1
jumped	1
out;	1
and,	1
after	1
giving	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
a	1
hasty	1
kiss,	1
hurried	1
into	1
the	1
vestibule,	1
where	1
Jane,	1
who	1
came	1
running	1
down	1
from	1
her	1
mother's	1
apartment,	1
immediately	1
met	1
her.	1
Elizabeth,	1
as	1
she	1
affectionately	1
embraced	1
her,	1
whilst	1
tears	1
filled	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
both,	1
lost	1
not	1
a	1
moment	1
in	1
asking	1
whether	1
anything	1
had	1
been	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
fugitives.	1
"Not	1
yet,"	1
replied	1
Jane.	1
"But	1
now	1
that	1
my	1
dear	1
uncle	1
is	1
come,	1
I	1
hope	1
everything	1
will	1
be	1
well."	1
"Is	1
my	1
father	1
in	1
town?"	1
"Yes,	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
Tuesday,	1
as	1
I	1
wrote	1
you	1
word."	1
"And	1
have	1
you	1
heard	1
from	1
him	1
often?"	1
"We	1
have	1
heard	1
only	1
twice.	1
He	1
wrote	1
me	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
on	1
Wednesday	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
arrived	1
in	1
safety,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
his	1
directions,	1
which	1
I	1
particularly	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
do.	1
He	1
merely	1
added	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
write	1
again	1
till	1
he	1
had	1
something	1
of	1
importance	1
to	1
mention."	1
"And	1
my	1
mother--how	1
is	1
she?	1
How	1
are	1
you	1
all?"	1
"My	1
mother	1
is	1
tolerably	1
well,	1
I	1
trust;	1
though	1
her	1
spirits	1
are	1
greatly	1
shaken.	1
She	1
is	1
up	1
stairs	1
and	1
will	1
have	1
great	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
seeing	1
you	1
all.	1
She	1
does	1
not	1
yet	1
leave	1
her	1
dressing-room.	1
Mary	1
and	1
Kitty,	1
thank	1
Heaven,	1
are	1
quite	1
well."	1
"But	1
you--how	1
are	1
you?"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth.	1
"You	1
look	1
pale.	1
How	1
much	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
gone	1
through!"	1
Her	1
sister,	1
however,	1
assured	1
her	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
perfectly	1
well;	1
and	1
their	1
conversation,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
passing	1
while	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
were	1
engaged	1
with	1
their	1
children,	1
was	1
now	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
by	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
party.	1
Jane	1
ran	1
to	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt,	1
and	1
welcomed	1
and	1
thanked	1
them	1
both,	1
with	1
alternate	1
smiles	1
and	1
tears.	1
When	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
the	1
questions	1
which	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
already	1
asked	1
were	1
of	1
course	1
repeated	1
by	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
they	1
soon	1
found	1
that	1
Jane	1
had	1
no	1
intelligence	1
to	1
give.	1
The	1
sanguine	1
hope	1
of	1
good,	1
however,	1
which	1
the	1
benevolence	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
suggested	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
deserted	1
her;	1
she	1
still	1
expected	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
all	1
end	1
well,	1
and	1
that	1
every	1
morning	1
would	1
bring	1
some	1
letter,	1
either	1
from	1
Lydia	1
or	1
her	1
father,	1
to	1
explain	1
their	1
proceedings,	1
and,	1
perhaps,	1
announce	1
their	1
marriage.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
to	1
whose	1
apartment	1
they	1
all	1
repaired,	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
minutes'	1
conversation	1
together,	1
received	1
them	1
exactly	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
expected;	1
with	1
tears	1
and	1
lamentations	1
of	1
regret,	1
invectives	1
against	1
the	1
villainous	1
conduct	1
of	1
Wickham,	1
and	1
complaints	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
sufferings	1
and	1
ill-usage;	1
blaming	1
everybody	1
but	1
the	1
person	1
to	1
whose	1
ill-judging	1
indulgence	1
the	1
errors	1
of	1
her	1
daughter	1
must	1
principally	1
be	1
owing.	1
"If	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
able,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"to	1
carry	1
my	1
point	1
in	1
going	1
to	1
Brighton,	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
family,	1
_this_	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
happened;	1
but	1
poor	1
dear	1
Lydia	1
had	1
nobody	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
her.	1
Why	1
did	1
the	1
Forsters	1
ever	1
let	1
her	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
sight?	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
great	1
neglect	1
or	1
other	1
on	1
their	1
side,	1
for	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
girl	1
to	1
do	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
well	1
looked	1
after.	1
I	1
always	1
thought	1
they	1
were	1
very	1
unfit	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
her;	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
overruled,	1
as	1
I	1
always	1
am.	1
Poor	1
dear	1
child!	1
And	1
now	1
here's	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
gone	1
away,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
will	1
fight	1
Wickham,	1
wherever	1
he	1
meets	1
him	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
killed,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
become	1
of	1
us	1
all?	1
The	1
Collinses	1
will	1
turn	1
us	1
out	1
before	1
he	1
is	1
cold	1
in	1
his	1
grave,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
kind	1
to	1
us,	1
brother,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
we	1
shall	1
do."	1
They	1
all	1
exclaimed	1
against	1
such	1
terrific	1
ideas;	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner,	1
after	1
general	1
assurances	1
of	1
his	1
affection	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
family,	1
told	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
London	1
the	1
very	1
next	1
day,	1
and	1
would	1
assist	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
in	1
every	1
endeavour	1
for	1
recovering	1
Lydia.	1
"Do	1
not	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
useless	1
alarm,"	1
added	1
he;	1
"though	1
it	1
is	1
right	1
to	1
be	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
worst,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
occasion	1
to	1
look	1
on	1
it	1
as	1
certain.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
quite	1
a	1
week	1
since	1
they	1
left	1
Brighton.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
more	1
we	1
may	1
gain	1
some	1
news	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
till	1
we	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
married,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
design	1
of	1
marrying,	1
do	1
not	1
let	1
us	1
give	1
the	1
matter	1
over	1
as	1
lost.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
get	1
to	1
town	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
my	1
brother,	1
and	1
make	1
him	1
come	1
home	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
Gracechurch	1
Street;	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
may	1
consult	1
together	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done."	1
"Oh!	1
my	1
dear	1
brother,"	1
replied	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
"that	1
is	1
exactly	1
what	1
I	1
could	1
most	1
wish	1
for.	1
And	1
now	1
do,	1
when	1
you	1
get	1
to	1
town,	1
find	1
them	1
out,	1
wherever	1
they	1
may	1
be;	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
married	1
already,	1
_make_	1
them	1
marry.	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
wedding	1
clothes,	1
do	1
not	1
let	1
them	1
wait	1
for	1
that,	1
but	1
tell	1
Lydia	1
she	1
shall	1
have	1
as	1
much	1
money	1
as	1
she	1
chooses	1
to	1
buy	1
them,	1
after	1
they	1
are	1
married.	1
And,	1
above	1
all,	1
keep	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
from	1
fighting.	1
Tell	1
him	1
what	1
a	1
dreadful	1
state	1
I	1
am	1
in,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
frighted	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
wits--and	1
have	1
such	1
tremblings,	1
such	1
flutterings,	1
all	1
over	1
me--such	1
spasms	1
in	1
my	1
side	1
and	1
pains	1
in	1
my	1
head,	1
and	1
such	1
beatings	1
at	1
heart,	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
get	1
no	1
rest	1
by	1
night	1
nor	1
by	1
day.	1
And	1
tell	1
my	1
dear	1
Lydia	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
any	1
directions	1
about	1
her	1
clothes	1
till	1
she	1
has	1
seen	1
me,	1
for	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
best	1
warehouses.	1
Oh,	1
brother,	1
how	1
kind	1
you	1
are!	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
will	1
contrive	1
it	1
all."	1
But	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner,	1
though	1
he	1
assured	1
her	1
again	1
of	1
his	1
earnest	1
endeavours	1
in	1
the	1
cause,	1
could	1
not	1
avoid	1
recommending	1
moderation	1
to	1
her,	1
as	1
well	1
in	1
her	1
hopes	1
as	1
her	1
fear;	1
and	1
after	1
talking	1
with	1
her	1
in	1
this	1
manner	1
till	1
dinner	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
they	1
all	1
left	1
her	1
to	1
vent	1
all	1
her	1
feelings	1
on	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
who	1
attended	1
in	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
her	1
daughters.	1
Though	1
her	1
brother	1
and	1
sister	1
were	1
persuaded	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
real	1
occasion	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
seclusion	1
from	1
the	1
family,	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
attempt	1
to	1
oppose	1
it,	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
prudence	1
enough	1
to	1
hold	1
her	1
tongue	1
before	1
the	1
servants,	1
while	1
they	1
waited	1
at	1
table,	1
and	1
judged	1
it	1
better	1
that	1
_one_	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
household,	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
whom	1
they	1
could	1
most	1
trust	1
should	1
comprehend	1
all	1
her	1
fears	1
and	1
solicitude	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
In	1
the	1
dining-room	1
they	1
were	1
soon	1
joined	1
by	1
Mary	1
and	1
Kitty,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
busily	1
engaged	1
in	1
their	1
separate	1
apartments	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
appearance	1
before.	1
One	1
came	1
from	1
her	1
books,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
from	1
her	1
toilette.	1
The	1
faces	1
of	1
both,	1
however,	1
were	1
tolerably	1
calm;	1
and	1
no	1
change	1
was	1
visible	1
in	1
either,	1
except	1
that	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
her	1
favourite	1
sister,	1
or	1
the	1
anger	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
herself	1
incurred	1
in	1
this	1
business,	1
had	1
given	1
more	1
of	1
fretfulness	1
than	1
usual	1
to	1
the	1
accents	1
of	1
Kitty.	1
As	1
for	1
Mary,	1
she	1
was	1
mistress	1
enough	1
of	1
herself	1
to	1
whisper	1
to	1
Elizabeth,	1
with	1
a	1
countenance	1
of	1
grave	1
reflection,	1
soon	1
after	1
they	1
were	1
seated	1
at	1
table:	1
"This	1
is	1
a	1
most	1
unfortunate	1
affair,	1
and	1
will	1
probably	1
be	1
much	1
talked	1
of.	1
But	1
we	1
must	1
stem	1
the	1
tide	1
of	1
malice,	1
and	1
pour	1
into	1
the	1
wounded	1
bosoms	1
of	1
each	1
other	1
the	1
balm	1
of	1
sisterly	1
consolation."	1
Then,	1
perceiving	1
in	1
Elizabeth	1
no	1
inclination	1
of	1
replying,	1
she	1
added,	1
"Unhappy	1
as	1
the	1
event	1
must	1
be	1
for	1
Lydia,	1
we	1
may	1
draw	1
from	1
it	1
this	1
useful	1
lesson:	1
that	1
loss	1
of	1
virtue	1
in	1
a	1
female	1
is	1
irretrievable;	1
that	1
one	1
false	1
step	1
involves	1
her	1
in	1
endless	1
ruin;	1
that	1
her	1
reputation	1
is	1
no	1
less	1
brittle	1
than	1
it	1
is	1
beautiful;	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
cannot	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
guarded	1
in	1
her	1
behaviour	1
towards	1
the	1
undeserving	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
sex."	1
Elizabeth	1
lifted	1
up	1
her	1
eyes	1
in	1
amazement,	1
but	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
oppressed	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
reply.	1
Mary,	1
however,	1
continued	1
to	1
console	1
herself	1
with	1
such	1
kind	1
of	1
moral	1
extractions	1
from	1
the	1
evil	1
before	1
them.	1
In	1
the	1
afternoon,	1
the	1
two	1
elder	1
Miss	1
Bennets	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
be	1
for	1
half-an-hour	1
by	1
themselves;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
instantly	1
availed	1
herself	1
of	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
making	1
any	1
inquiries,	1
which	1
Jane	1
was	1
equally	1
eager	1
to	1
satisfy.	1
After	1
joining	1
in	1
general	1
lamentations	1
over	1
the	1
dreadful	1
sequel	1
of	1
this	1
event,	1
which	1
Elizabeth	1
considered	1
as	1
all	1
but	1
certain,	1
and	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
could	1
not	1
assert	1
to	1
be	1
wholly	1
impossible,	1
the	1
former	1
continued	1
the	1
subject,	1
by	1
saying,	1
"But	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
and	1
everything	1
about	1
it	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
already	1
heard.	1
Give	1
me	1
further	1
particulars.	1
What	1
did	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
say?	1
Had	1
they	1
no	1
apprehension	1
of	1
anything	1
before	1
the	1
elopement	1
took	1
place?	1
They	1
must	1
have	1
seen	1
them	1
together	1
for	1
ever."	1
"Colonel	1
Forster	1
did	1
own	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
often	1
suspected	1
some	1
partiality,	1
especially	1
on	1
Lydia's	1
side,	1
but	1
nothing	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
any	1
alarm.	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
grieved	1
for	1
him!	1
His	1
behaviour	1
was	1
attentive	1
and	1
kind	1
to	1
the	1
utmost.	1
He	1
_was_	1
coming	1
to	1
us,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
assure	1
us	1
of	1
his	1
concern,	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
idea	1
of	1
their	1
not	1
being	1
gone	1
to	1
Scotland:	1
when	1
that	1
apprehension	1
first	1
got	1
abroad,	1
it	1
hastened	1
his	1
journey."	1
"And	1
was	1
Denny	1
convinced	1
that	1
Wickham	1
would	1
not	1
marry?	1
Did	1
he	1
know	1
of	1
their	1
intending	1
to	1
go	1
off?	1
Had	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
seen	1
Denny	1
himself?"	1
"Yes;	1
but,	1
when	1
questioned	1
by	1
_him_,	1
Denny	1
denied	1
knowing	1
anything	1
of	1
their	1
plans,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
his	1
real	1
opinion	1
about	1
it.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
repeat	1
his	1
persuasion	1
of	1
their	1
not	1
marrying--and	1
from	1
_that_,	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
hope,	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
misunderstood	1
before."	1
"And	1
till	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
came	1
himself,	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
entertained	1
a	1
doubt,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
really	1
married?"	1
"How	1
was	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
such	1
an	1
idea	1
should	1
enter	1
our	1
brains?	1
I	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
uneasy--a	1
little	1
fearful	1
of	1
my	1
sister's	1
happiness	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
marriage,	1
because	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
his	1
conduct	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
always	1
quite	1
right.	1
My	1
father	1
and	1
mother	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
that;	1
they	1
only	1
felt	1
how	1
imprudent	1
a	1
match	1
it	1
must	1
be.	1
Kitty	1
then	1
owned,	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
natural	1
triumph	1
on	1
knowing	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
us,	1
that	1
in	1
Lydia's	1
last	1
letter	1
she	1
had	1
prepared	1
her	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
step.	1
She	1
had	1
known,	1
it	1
seems,	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
each	1
other,	1
many	1
weeks."	1
"But	1
not	1
before	1
they	1
went	1
to	1
Brighton?"	1
"No,	1
I	1
believe	1
not."	1
"And	1
did	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
appear	1
to	1
think	1
well	1
of	1
Wickham	1
himself?	1
Does	1
he	1
know	1
his	1
real	1
character?"	1
"I	1
must	1
confess	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
so	1
well	1
of	1
Wickham	1
as	1
he	1
formerly	1
did.	1
He	1
believed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
imprudent	1
and	1
extravagant.	1
And	1
since	1
this	1
sad	1
affair	1
has	1
taken	1
place,	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
Meryton	1
greatly	1
in	1
debt;	1
but	1
I	1
hope	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
false."	1
"Oh,	1
Jane,	1
had	1
we	1
been	1
less	1
secret,	1
had	1
we	1
told	1
what	1
we	1
knew	1
of	1
him,	1
this	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
happened!"	1
"Perhaps	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better,"	1
replied	1
her	1
sister.	1
"But	1
to	1
expose	1
the	1
former	1
faults	1
of	1
any	1
person	1
without	1
knowing	1
what	1
their	1
present	1
feelings	1
were,	1
seemed	1
unjustifiable.	1
We	1
acted	1
with	1
the	1
best	1
intentions."	1
"Could	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
repeat	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
Lydia's	1
note	1
to	1
his	1
wife?"	1
"He	1
brought	1
it	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
see."	1
Jane	1
then	1
took	1
it	1
from	1
her	1
pocket-book,	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
Elizabeth.	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
contents:	1
"MY	1
DEAR	1
HARRIET,	1
"You	1
will	1
laugh	1
when	1
you	1
know	1
where	1
I	1
am	1
gone,	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
laughing	1
myself	1
at	1
your	1
surprise	1
to-morrow	1
morning,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
missed.	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
Gretna	1
Green,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
cannot	1
guess	1
with	1
who,	1
I	1
shall	1
think	1
you	1
a	1
simpleton,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
but	1
one	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
I	1
love,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
angel.	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
be	1
happy	1
without	1
him,	1
so	1
think	1
it	1
no	1
harm	1
to	1
be	1
off.	1
You	1
need	1
not	1
send	1
them	1
word	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
of	1
my	1
going,	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
it,	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
surprise	1
the	1
greater,	1
when	1
I	1
write	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
sign	1
my	1
name	1
'Lydia	1
Wickham.'	1
What	1
a	1
good	1
joke	1
it	1
will	1
be!	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
write	1
for	1
laughing.	1
Pray	1
make	1
my	1
excuses	1
to	1
Pratt	1
for	1
not	1
keeping	1
my	1
engagement,	1
and	1
dancing	1
with	1
him	1
to-night.	1
Tell	1
him	1
I	1
hope	1
he	1
will	1
excuse	1
me	1
when	1
he	1
knows	1
all;	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
I	1
will	1
dance	1
with	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
next	1
ball	1
we	1
meet,	1
with	1
great	1
pleasure.	1
I	1
shall	1
send	1
for	1
my	1
clothes	1
when	1
I	1
get	1
to	1
Longbourn;	1
but	1
I	1
wish	1
you	1
would	1
tell	1
Sally	1
to	1
mend	1
a	1
great	1
slit	1
in	1
my	1
worked	1
muslin	1
gown	1
before	1
they	1
are	1
packed	1
up.	1
Good-bye.	1
Give	1
my	1
love	1
to	1
Colonel	1
Forster.	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
drink	1
to	1
our	1
good	1
journey.	1
"Your	1
affectionate	1
friend,	1
"LYDIA	1
BENNET."	1
"Oh!	1
thoughtless,	1
thoughtless	1
Lydia!"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
it.	1
"What	1
a	1
letter	1
is	1
this,	1
to	1
be	1
written	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
moment!	1
But	1
at	1
least	1
it	1
shows	1
that	1
_she_	1
was	1
serious	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
their	1
journey.	1
Whatever	1
he	1
might	1
afterwards	1
persuade	1
her	1
to,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
on	1
her	1
side	1
a	1
_scheme_	1
of	1
infamy.	1
My	1
poor	1
father!	1
how	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
felt	1
it!"	1
"I	1
never	1
saw	1
anyone	1
so	1
shocked.	1
He	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
a	1
word	1
for	1
full	1
ten	1
minutes.	1
My	1
mother	1
was	1
taken	1
ill	1
immediately,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
house	1
in	1
such	1
confusion!"	1
"Oh!	1
Jane,"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth,	1
"was	1
there	1
a	1
servant	1
belonging	1
to	1
it	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
before	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
day?"	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know.	1
I	1
hope	1
there	1
was.	1
But	1
to	1
be	1
guarded	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
is	1
very	1
difficult.	1
My	1
mother	1
was	1
in	1
hysterics,	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
every	1
assistance	1
in	1
my	1
power,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
done!	1
But	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
what	1
might	1
possibly	1
happen	1
almost	1
took	1
from	1
me	1
my	1
faculties."	1
"Your	1
attendance	1
upon	1
her	1
has	1
been	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
you.	1
You	1
do	1
not	1
look	1
well.	1
Oh	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
you!	1
you	1
have	1
had	1
every	1
care	1
and	1
anxiety	1
upon	1
yourself	1
alone."	1
"Mary	1
and	1
Kitty	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
kind,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
shared	1
in	1
every	1
fatigue,	1
I	1
am	1
sure;	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
right	1
for	1
either	1
of	1
them.	1
Kitty	1
is	1
slight	1
and	1
delicate;	1
and	1
Mary	1
studies	1
so	1
much,	1
that	1
her	1
hours	1
of	1
repose	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
broken	1
in	1
on.	1
My	1
aunt	1
Phillips	1
came	1
to	1
Longbourn	1
on	1
Tuesday,	1
after	1
my	1
father	1
went	1
away;	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
stay	1
till	1
Thursday	1
with	1
me.	1
She	1
was	1
of	1
great	1
use	1
and	1
comfort	1
to	1
us	1
all.	1
And	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
kind;	1
she	1
walked	1
here	1
on	1
Wednesday	1
morning	1
to	1
condole	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
offered	1
her	1
services,	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
her	1
daughters',	1
if	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
us."	1
"She	1
had	1
better	1
have	1
stayed	1
at	1
home,"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth;	1
"perhaps	1
she	1
_meant_	1
well,	1
but,	1
under	1
such	1
a	1
misfortune	1
as	1
this,	1
one	1
cannot	1
see	1
too	1
little	1
of	1
one's	1
neighbours.	1
Assistance	1
is	1
impossible;	1
condolence	1
insufferable.	1
Let	1
them	1
triumph	1
over	1
us	1
at	1
a	1
distance,	1
and	1
be	1
satisfied."	1
She	1
then	1
proceeded	1
to	1
inquire	1
into	1
the	1
measures	1
which	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
intended	1
to	1
pursue,	1
while	1
in	1
town,	1
for	1
the	1
recovery	1
of	1
his	1
daughter.	1
"He	1
meant	1
I	1
believe,"	1
replied	1
Jane,	1
"to	1
go	1
to	1
Epsom,	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
last	1
changed	1
horses,	1
see	1
the	1
postilions	1
and	1
try	1
if	1
anything	1
could	1
be	1
made	1
out	1
from	1
them.	1
His	1
principal	1
object	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
hackney	1
coach	1
which	1
took	1
them	1
from	1
Clapham.	1
It	1
had	1
come	1
with	1
a	1
fare	1
from	1
London;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
circumstance	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman	1
and	1
lady's	1
removing	1
from	1
one	1
carriage	1
into	1
another	1
might	1
be	1
remarked	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
make	1
inquiries	1
at	1
Clapham.	1
If	1
he	1
could	1
anyhow	1
discover	1
at	1
what	1
house	1
the	1
coachman	1
had	1
before	1
set	1
down	1
his	1
fare,	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
make	1
inquiries	1
there,	1
and	1
hoped	1
it	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
impossible	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
stand	1
and	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
coach.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
designs	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
formed;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
be	1
gone,	1
and	1
his	1
spirits	1
so	1
greatly	1
discomposed,	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
difficulty	1
in	1
finding	1
out	1
even	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
this."	1
Chapter	1
48	1
The	1
whole	1
party	1
were	1
in	1
hopes	1
of	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
but	1
the	1
post	1
came	1
in	1
without	1
bringing	1
a	1
single	1
line	1
from	1
him.	1
His	1
family	1
knew	1
him	1
to	1
be,	1
on	1
all	1
common	1
occasions,	1
a	1
most	1
negligent	1
and	1
dilatory	1
correspondent;	1
but	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
they	1
had	1
hoped	1
for	1
exertion.	1
They	1
were	1
forced	1
to	1
conclude	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
pleasing	1
intelligence	1
to	1
send;	1
but	1
even	1
of	1
_that_	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
certain.	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
had	1
waited	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
letters	1
before	1
he	1
set	1
off.	1
When	1
he	1
was	1
gone,	1
they	1
were	1
certain	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
receiving	1
constant	1
information	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on,	1
and	1
their	1
uncle	1
promised,	1
at	1
parting,	1
to	1
prevail	1
on	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Longbourn,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
consolation	1
of	1
his	1
sister,	1
who	1
considered	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
only	1
security	1
for	1
her	1
husband's	1
not	1
being	1
killed	1
in	1
a	1
duel.	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
were	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
Hertfordshire	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
longer,	1
as	1
the	1
former	1
thought	1
her	1
presence	1
might	1
be	1
serviceable	1
to	1
her	1
nieces.	1
She	1
shared	1
in	1
their	1
attendance	1
on	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
comfort	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
hours	1
of	1
freedom.	1
Their	1
other	1
aunt	1
also	1
visited	1
them	1
frequently,	1
and	1
always,	1
as	1
she	1
said,	1
with	1
the	1
design	1
of	1
cheering	1
and	1
heartening	1
them	1
up--though,	1
as	1
she	1
never	1
came	1
without	1
reporting	1
some	1
fresh	1
instance	1
of	1
Wickham's	1
extravagance	1
or	1
irregularity,	1
she	1
seldom	1
went	1
away	1
without	1
leaving	1
them	1
more	1
dispirited	1
than	1
she	1
found	1
them.	1
All	1
Meryton	1
seemed	1
striving	1
to	1
blacken	1
the	1
man	1
who,	1
but	1
three	1
months	1
before,	1
had	1
been	1
almost	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
light.	1
He	1
was	1
declared	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
debt	1
to	1
every	1
tradesman	1
in	1
the	1
place,	1
and	1
his	1
intrigues,	1
all	1
honoured	1
with	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
seduction,	1
had	1
been	1
extended	1
into	1
every	1
tradesman's	1
family.	1
Everybody	1
declared	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
wickedest	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
everybody	1
began	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
always	1
distrusted	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
his	1
goodness.	1
Elizabeth,	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
credit	1
above	1
half	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
said,	1
believed	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
former	1
assurance	1
of	1
her	1
sister's	1
ruin	1
more	1
certain;	1
and	1
even	1
Jane,	1
who	1
believed	1
still	1
less	1
of	1
it,	1
became	1
almost	1
hopeless,	1
more	1
especially	1
as	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
now	1
come	1
when,	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
Scotland,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
entirely	1
despaired	1
of,	1
they	1
must	1
in	1
all	1
probability	1
have	1
gained	1
some	1
news	1
of	1
them.	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
left	1
Longbourn	1
on	1
Sunday;	1
on	1
Tuesday	1
his	1
wife	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
him;	1
it	1
told	1
them	1
that,	1
on	1
his	1
arrival,	1
he	1
had	1
immediately	1
found	1
out	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
persuaded	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Gracechurch	1
Street;	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
Epsom	1
and	1
Clapham,	1
before	1
his	1
arrival,	1
but	1
without	1
gaining	1
any	1
satisfactory	1
information;	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
determined	1
to	1
inquire	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
principal	1
hotels	1
in	1
town,	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
thought	1
it	1
possible	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
on	1
their	1
first	1
coming	1
to	1
London,	1
before	1
they	1
procured	1
lodgings.	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
himself	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
any	1
success	1
from	1
this	1
measure,	1
but	1
as	1
his	1
brother	1
was	1
eager	1
in	1
it,	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
assist	1
him	1
in	1
pursuing	1
it.	1
He	1
added	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
seemed	1
wholly	1
disinclined	1
at	1
present	1
to	1
leave	1
London	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
write	1
again	1
very	1
soon.	1
There	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
postscript	1
to	1
this	1
effect:	1
"I	1
have	1
written	1
to	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
to	1
desire	1
him	1
to	1
find	1
out,	1
if	1
possible,	1
from	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
intimates	1
in	1
the	1
regiment,	1
whether	1
Wickham	1
has	1
any	1
relations	1
or	1
connections	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
likely	1
to	1
know	1
in	1
what	1
part	1
of	1
town	1
he	1
has	1
now	1
concealed	1
himself.	1
If	1
there	1
were	1
anyone	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
apply	1
to	1
with	1
a	1
probability	1
of	1
gaining	1
such	1
a	1
clue	1
as	1
that,	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
of	1
essential	1
consequence.	1
At	1
present	1
we	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
guide	1
us.	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
will,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
do	1
everything	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
satisfy	1
us	1
on	1
this	1
head.	1
But,	1
on	1
second	1
thoughts,	1
perhaps,	1
Lizzy	1
could	1
tell	1
us	1
what	1
relations	1
he	1
has	1
now	1
living,	1
better	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
person."	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
at	1
no	1
loss	1
to	1
understand	1
from	1
whence	1
this	1
deference	1
to	1
her	1
authority	1
proceeded;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
give	1
any	1
information	1
of	1
so	1
satisfactory	1
a	1
nature	1
as	1
the	1
compliment	1
deserved.	1
She	1
had	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
had	1
any	1
relations,	1
except	1
a	1
father	1
and	1
mother,	1
both	1
of	1
whom	1
had	1
been	1
dead	1
many	1
years.	1
It	1
was	1
possible,	1
however,	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
companions	1
in	1
the	1
----shire	1
might	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
more	1
information;	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
sanguine	1
in	1
expecting	1
it,	1
the	1
application	1
was	1
a	1
something	1
to	1
look	1
forward	1
to.	1
Every	1
day	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
was	1
now	1
a	1
day	1
of	1
anxiety;	1
but	1
the	1
most	1
anxious	1
part	1
of	1
each	1
was	1
when	1
the	1
post	1
was	1
expected.	1
The	1
arrival	1
of	1
letters	1
was	1
the	1
grand	1
object	1
of	1
every	1
morning's	1
impatience.	1
Through	1
letters,	1
whatever	1
of	1
good	1
or	1
bad	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
would	1
be	1
communicated,	1
and	1
every	1
succeeding	1
day	1
was	1
expected	1
to	1
bring	1
some	1
news	1
of	1
importance.	1
But	1
before	1
they	1
heard	1
again	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner,	1
a	1
letter	1
arrived	1
for	1
their	1
father,	1
from	1
a	1
different	1
quarter,	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Collins;	1
which,	1
as	1
Jane	1
had	1
received	1
directions	1
to	1
open	1
all	1
that	1
came	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
absence,	1
she	1
accordingly	1
read;	1
and	1
Elizabeth,	1
who	1
knew	1
what	1
curiosities	1
his	1
letters	1
always	1
were,	1
looked	1
over	1
her,	1
and	1
read	1
it	1
likewise.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
follows:	1
"MY	1
DEAR	1
SIR,	1
"I	1
feel	1
myself	1
called	1
upon,	1
by	1
our	1
relationship,	1
and	1
my	1
situation	1
in	1
life,	1
to	1
condole	1
with	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
grievous	1
affliction	1
you	1
are	1
now	1
suffering	1
under,	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
were	1
yesterday	1
informed	1
by	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Hertfordshire.	1
Be	1
assured,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,	1
that	1
Mrs.	1
Collins	1
and	1
myself	1
sincerely	1
sympathise	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
all	1
your	1
respectable	1
family,	1
in	1
your	1
present	1
distress,	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
bitterest	1
kind,	1
because	1
proceeding	1
from	1
a	1
cause	1
which	1
no	1
time	1
can	1
remove.	1
No	1
arguments	1
shall	1
be	1
wanting	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
that	1
can	1
alleviate	1
so	1
severe	1
a	1
misfortune--or	1
that	1
may	1
comfort	1
you,	1
under	1
a	1
circumstance	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
of	1
all	1
others	1
the	1
most	1
afflicting	1
to	1
a	1
parent's	1
mind.	1
The	1
death	1
of	1
your	1
daughter	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
blessing	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
this.	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
lamented,	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
reason	1
to	1
suppose	1
as	1
my	1
dear	1
Charlotte	1
informs	1
me,	1
that	1
this	1
licentiousness	1
of	1
behaviour	1
in	1
your	1
daughter	1
has	1
proceeded	1
from	1
a	1
faulty	1
degree	1
of	1
indulgence;	1
though,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
for	1
the	1
consolation	1
of	1
yourself	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
her	1
own	1
disposition	1
must	1
be	1
naturally	1
bad,	1
or	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
guilty	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
enormity,	1
at	1
so	1
early	1
an	1
age.	1
Howsoever	1
that	1
may	1
be,	1
you	1
are	1
grievously	1
to	1
be	1
pitied;	1
in	1
which	1
opinion	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
only	1
joined	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Collins,	1
but	1
likewise	1
by	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
and	1
her	1
daughter,	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
related	1
the	1
affair.	1
They	1
agree	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
apprehending	1
that	1
this	1
false	1
step	1
in	1
one	1
daughter	1
will	1
be	1
injurious	1
to	1
the	1
fortunes	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
others;	1
for	1
who,	1
as	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
herself	1
condescendingly	1
says,	1
will	1
connect	1
themselves	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
family?	1
And	1
this	1
consideration	1
leads	1
me	1
moreover	1
to	1
reflect,	1
with	1
augmented	1
satisfaction,	1
on	1
a	1
certain	1
event	1
of	1
last	1
November;	1
for	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
otherwise,	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
involved	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
sorrow	1
and	1
disgrace.	1
Let	1
me	1
then	1
advise	1
you,	1
dear	1
sir,	1
to	1
console	1
yourself	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible,	1
to	1
throw	1
off	1
your	1
unworthy	1
child	1
from	1
your	1
affection	1
for	1
ever,	1
and	1
leave	1
her	1
to	1
reap	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
heinous	1
offense.	1
"I	1
am,	1
dear	1
sir,	1
etc.,	1
etc."	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
did	1
not	1
write	1
again	1
till	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
an	1
answer	1
from	1
Colonel	1
Forster;	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
of	1
a	1
pleasant	1
nature	1
to	1
send.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
known	1
that	1
Wickham	1
had	1
a	1
single	1
relationship	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
kept	1
up	1
any	1
connection,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
certain	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
near	1
one	1
living.	1
His	1
former	1
acquaintances	1
had	1
been	1
numerous;	1
but	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
militia,	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
terms	1
of	1
particular	1
friendship	1
with	1
any	1
of	1
them.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
one,	1
therefore,	1
who	1
could	1
be	1
pointed	1
out	1
as	1
likely	1
to	1
give	1
any	1
news	1
of	1
him.	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
wretched	1
state	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
finances,	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
powerful	1
motive	1
for	1
secrecy,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
his	1
fear	1
of	1
discovery	1
by	1
Lydia's	1
relations,	1
for	1
it	1
had	1
just	1
transpired	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
gaming	1
debts	1
behind	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
very	1
considerable	1
amount.	1
Colonel	1
Forster	1
believed	1
that	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
would	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
clear	1
his	1
expenses	1
at	1
Brighton.	1
He	1
owed	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
in	1
town,	1
but	1
his	1
debts	1
of	1
honour	1
were	1
still	1
more	1
formidable.	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
did	1
not	1
attempt	1
to	1
conceal	1
these	1
particulars	1
from	1
the	1
Longbourn	1
family.	1
Jane	1
heard	1
them	1
with	1
horror.	1
"A	1
gamester!"	1
she	1
cried.	1
"This	1
is	1
wholly	1
unexpected.	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
it."	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
added	1
in	1
his	1
letter,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
expect	1
to	1
see	1
their	1
father	1
at	1
home	1
on	1
the	1
following	1
day,	1
which	1
was	1
Saturday.	1
Rendered	1
spiritless	1
by	1
the	1
ill-success	1
of	1
all	1
their	1
endeavours,	1
he	1
had	1
yielded	1
to	1
his	1
brother-in-law's	1
entreaty	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
family,	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
whatever	1
occasion	1
might	1
suggest	1
to	1
be	1
advisable	1
for	1
continuing	1
their	1
pursuit.	1
When	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
told	1
of	1
this,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
express	1
so	1
much	1
satisfaction	1
as	1
her	1
children	1
expected,	1
considering	1
what	1
her	1
anxiety	1
for	1
his	1
life	1
had	1
been	1
before.	1
"What,	1
is	1
he	1
coming	1
home,	1
and	1
without	1
poor	1
Lydia?"	1
she	1
cried.	1
"Sure	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
leave	1
London	1
before	1
he	1
has	1
found	1
them.	1
Who	1
is	1
to	1
fight	1
Wickham,	1
and	1
make	1
him	1
marry	1
her,	1
if	1
he	1
comes	1
away?"	1
As	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
began	1
to	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
home,	1
it	1
was	1
settled	1
that	1
she	1
and	1
the	1
children	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
London,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
came	1
from	1
it.	1
The	1
coach,	1
therefore,	1
took	1
them	1
the	1
first	1
stage	1
of	1
their	1
journey,	1
and	1
brought	1
its	1
master	1
back	1
to	1
Longbourn.	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
went	1
away	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
perplexity	1
about	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
her	1
Derbyshire	1
friend	1
that	1
had	1
attended	1
her	1
from	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
His	1
name	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
voluntarily	1
mentioned	1
before	1
them	1
by	1
her	1
niece;	1
and	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
half-expectation	1
which	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
had	1
formed,	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
him,	1
had	1
ended	1
in	1
nothing.	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
received	1
none	1
since	1
her	1
return	1
that	1
could	1
come	1
from	1
Pemberley.	1
The	1
present	1
unhappy	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
rendered	1
any	1
other	1
excuse	1
for	1
the	1
lowness	1
of	1
her	1
spirits	1
unnecessary;	1
nothing,	1
therefore,	1
could	1
be	1
fairly	1
conjectured	1
from	1
_that_,	1
though	1
Elizabeth,	1
who	1
was	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
tolerably	1
well	1
acquainted	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
feelings,	1
was	1
perfectly	1
aware	1
that,	1
had	1
she	1
known	1
nothing	1
of	1
Darcy,	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
borne	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
Lydia's	1
infamy	1
somewhat	1
better.	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
spared	1
her,	1
she	1
thought,	1
one	1
sleepless	1
night	1
out	1
of	1
two.	1
When	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
arrived,	1
he	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
his	1
usual	1
philosophic	1
composure.	1
He	1
said	1
as	1
little	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
saying;	1
made	1
no	1
mention	1
of	1
the	1
business	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
time	1
before	1
his	1
daughters	1
had	1
courage	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
till	1
the	1
afternoon,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
joined	1
them	1
at	1
tea,	1
that	1
Elizabeth	1
ventured	1
to	1
introduce	1
the	1
subject;	1
and	1
then,	1
on	1
her	1
briefly	1
expressing	1
her	1
sorrow	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
endured,	1
he	1
replied,	1
"Say	1
nothing	1
of	1
that.	1
Who	1
should	1
suffer	1
but	1
myself?	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
my	1
own	1
doing,	1
and	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
feel	1
it."	1
"You	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
too	1
severe	1
upon	1
yourself,"	1
replied	1
Elizabeth.	1
"You	1
may	1
well	1
warn	1
me	1
against	1
such	1
an	1
evil.	1
Human	1
nature	1
is	1
so	1
prone	1
to	1
fall	1
into	1
it!	1
No,	1
Lizzy,	1
let	1
me	1
once	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
feel	1
how	1
much	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
blame.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
overpowered	1
by	1
the	1
impression.	1
It	1
will	1
pass	1
away	1
soon	1
enough."	1
"Do	1
you	1
suppose	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
London?"	1
"Yes;	1
where	1
else	1
can	1
they	1
be	1
so	1
well	1
concealed?"	1
"And	1
Lydia	1
used	1
to	1
want	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
London,"	1
added	1
Kitty.	1
"She	1
is	1
happy	1
then,"	1
said	1
her	1
father	1
drily;	1
"and	1
her	1
residence	1
there	1
will	1
probably	1
be	1
of	1
some	1
duration."	1
Then	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
silence	1
he	1
continued:	1
"Lizzy,	1
I	1
bear	1
you	1
no	1
ill-will	1
for	1
being	1
justified	1
in	1
your	1
advice	1
to	1
me	1
last	1
May,	1
which,	1
considering	1
the	1
event,	1
shows	1
some	1
greatness	1
of	1
mind."	1
They	1
were	1
interrupted	1
by	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
fetch	1
her	1
mother's	1
tea.	1
"This	1
is	1
a	1
parade,"	1
he	1
cried,	1
"which	1
does	1
one	1
good;	1
it	1
gives	1
such	1
an	1
elegance	1
to	1
misfortune!	1
Another	1
day	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
same;	1
I	1
will	1
sit	1
in	1
my	1
library,	1
in	1
my	1
nightcap	1
and	1
powdering	1
gown,	1
and	1
give	1
as	1
much	1
trouble	1
as	1
I	1
can;	1
or,	1
perhaps,	1
I	1
may	1
defer	1
it	1
till	1
Kitty	1
runs	1
away."	1
"I	1
am	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
run	1
away,	1
papa,"	1
said	1
Kitty	1
fretfully.	1
"If	1
I	1
should	1
ever	1
go	1
to	1
Brighton,	1
I	1
would	1
behave	1
better	1
than	1
Lydia."	1
"_You_	1
go	1
to	1
Brighton.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
trust	1
you	1
so	1
near	1
it	1
as	1
Eastbourne	1
for	1
fifty	1
pounds!	1
No,	1
Kitty,	1
I	1
have	1
at	1
last	1
learnt	1
to	1
be	1
cautious,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
feel	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
it.	1
No	1
officer	1
is	1
ever	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
house	1
again,	1
nor	1
even	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
village.	1
Balls	1
will	1
be	1
absolutely	1
prohibited,	1
unless	1
you	1
stand	1
up	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
sisters.	1
And	1
you	1
are	1
never	1
to	1
stir	1
out	1
of	1
doors	1
till	1
you	1
can	1
prove	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
spent	1
ten	1
minutes	1
of	1
every	1
day	1
in	1
a	1
rational	1
manner."	1
Kitty,	1
who	1
took	1
all	1
these	1
threats	1
in	1
a	1
serious	1
light,	1
began	1
to	1
cry.	1
"Well,	1
well,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"do	1
not	1
make	1
yourself	1
unhappy.	1
If	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
good	1
girl	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
ten	1
years,	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
you	1
to	1
a	1
review	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
them."	1
Chapter	1
49	1
Two	1
days	1
after	1
Mr.	1
Bennet's	1
return,	1
as	1
Jane	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
were	1
walking	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
shrubbery	1
behind	1
the	1
house,	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
coming	1
towards	1
them,	1
and,	1
concluding	1
that	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
call	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
mother,	1
went	1
forward	1
to	1
meet	1
her;	1
but,	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
expected	1
summons,	1
when	1
they	1
approached	1
her,	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
"I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon,	1
madam,	1
for	1
interrupting	1
you,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
hopes	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
got	1
some	1
good	1
news	1
from	1
town,	1
so	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
coming	1
to	1
ask."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean,	1
Hill?	1
We	1
have	1
heard	1
nothing	1
from	1
town."	1
"Dear	1
madam,"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Hill,	1
in	1
great	1
astonishment,	1
"don't	1
you	1
know	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
express	1
come	1
for	1
master	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner?	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
here	1
this	1
half-hour,	1
and	1
master	1
has	1
had	1
a	1
letter."	1
Away	1
ran	1
the	1
girls,	1
too	1
eager	1
to	1
get	1
in	1
to	1
have	1
time	1
for	1
speech.	1
They	1
ran	1
through	1
the	1
vestibule	1
into	1
the	1
breakfast-room;	1
from	1
thence	1
to	1
the	1
library;	1
their	1
father	1
was	1
in	1
neither;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
seeking	1
him	1
up	1
stairs	1
with	1
their	1
mother,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
met	1
by	1
the	1
butler,	1
who	1
said:	1
"If	1
you	1
are	1
looking	1
for	1
my	1
master,	1
ma'am,	1
he	1
is	1
walking	1
towards	1
the	1
little	1
copse."	1
Upon	1
this	1
information,	1
they	1
instantly	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
hall	1
once	1
more,	1
and	1
ran	1
across	1
the	1
lawn	1
after	1
their	1
father,	1
who	1
was	1
deliberately	1
pursuing	1
his	1
way	1
towards	1
a	1
small	1
wood	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
paddock.	1
Jane,	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
light	1
nor	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
running	1
as	1
Elizabeth,	1
soon	1
lagged	1
behind,	1
while	1
her	1
sister,	1
panting	1
for	1
breath,	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
eagerly	1
cried	1
out:	1
"Oh,	1
papa,	1
what	1
news--what	1
news?	1
Have	1
you	1
heard	1
from	1
my	1
uncle?"	1
"Yes	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
him	1
by	1
express."	1
"Well,	1
and	1
what	1
news	1
does	1
it	1
bring--good	1
or	1
bad?"	1
"What	1
is	1
there	1
of	1
good	1
to	1
be	1
expected?"	1
said	1
he,	1
taking	1
the	1
letter	1
from	1
his	1
pocket.	1
"But	1
perhaps	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
read	1
it."	1
Elizabeth	1
impatiently	1
caught	1
it	1
from	1
his	1
hand.	1
Jane	1
now	1
came	1
up.	1
"Read	1
it	1
aloud,"	1
said	1
their	1
father,	1
"for	1
I	1
hardly	1
know	1
myself	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
about."	1
"Gracechurch	1
Street,	1
Monday,	1
August	1
2.	1
"MY	1
DEAR	1
BROTHER,	1
"At	1
last	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
to	1
send	1
you	1
some	1
tidings	1
of	1
my	1
niece,	1
and	1
such	1
as,	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
satisfaction.	1
Soon	1
after	1
you	1
left	1
me	1
on	1
Saturday,	1
I	1
was	1
fortunate	1
enough	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
in	1
what	1
part	1
of	1
London	1
they	1
were.	1
The	1
particulars	1
I	1
reserve	1
till	1
we	1
meet;	1
it	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
know	1
they	1
are	1
discovered.	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
them	1
both--"	1
"Then	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
I	1
always	1
hoped,"	1
cried	1
Jane;	1
"they	1
are	1
married!"	1
Elizabeth	1
read	1
on:	1
"I	1
have	1
seen	1
them	1
both.	1
They	1
are	1
not	1
married,	1
nor	1
can	1
I	1
find	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
intention	1
of	1
being	1
so;	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
willing	1
to	1
perform	1
the	1
engagements	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
ventured	1
to	1
make	1
on	1
your	1
side,	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
long	1
before	1
they	1
are.	1
All	1
that	1
is	1
required	1
of	1
you	1
is,	1
to	1
assure	1
to	1
your	1
daughter,	1
by	1
settlement,	1
her	1
equal	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
five	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
secured	1
among	1
your	1
children	1
after	1
the	1
decease	1
of	1
yourself	1
and	1
my	1
sister;	1
and,	1
moreover,	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
an	1
engagement	1
of	1
allowing	1
her,	1
during	1
your	1
life,	1
one	1
hundred	1
pounds	1
per	1
annum.	1
These	1
are	1
conditions	1
which,	1
considering	1
everything,	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
hesitation	1
in	1
complying	1
with,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
thought	1
myself	1
privileged,	1
for	1
you.	1
I	1
shall	1
send	1
this	1
by	1
express,	1
that	1
no	1
time	1
may	1
be	1
lost	1
in	1
bringing	1
me	1
your	1
answer.	1
You	1
will	1
easily	1
comprehend,	1
from	1
these	1
particulars,	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Wickham's	1
circumstances	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
hopeless	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
generally	1
believed	1
to	1
be.	1
The	1
world	1
has	1
been	1
deceived	1
in	1
that	1
respect;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
happy	1
to	1
say	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
some	1
little	1
money,	1
even	1
when	1
all	1
his	1
debts	1
are	1
discharged,	1
to	1
settle	1
on	1
my	1
niece,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
fortune.	1
If,	1
as	1
I	1
conclude	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
case,	1
you	1
send	1
me	1
full	1
powers	1
to	1
act	1
in	1
your	1
name	1
throughout	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
this	1
business,	1
I	1
will	1
immediately	1
give	1
directions	1
to	1
Haggerston	1
for	1
preparing	1
a	1
proper	1
settlement.	1
There	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
smallest	1
occasion	1
for	1
your	1
coming	1
to	1
town	1
again;	1
therefore	1
stay	1
quiet	1
at	1
Longbourn,	1
and	1
depend	1
on	1
my	1
diligence	1
and	1
care.	1
Send	1
back	1
your	1
answer	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
you	1
can,	1
and	1
be	1
careful	1
to	1
write	1
explicitly.	1
We	1
have	1
judged	1
it	1
best	1
that	1
my	1
niece	1
should	1
be	1
married	1
from	1
this	1
house,	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
approve.	1
She	1
comes	1
to	1
us	1
to-day.	1
I	1
shall	1
write	1
again	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
anything	1
more	1
is	1
determined	1
on.	1
Yours,	1
etc.,	1
"EDW.	1
GARDINER."	1
"Is	1
it	1
possible?"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
finished.	1
"Can	1
it	1
be	1
possible	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
marry	1
her?"	1
"Wickham	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
undeserving,	1
then,	1
as	1
we	1
thought	1
him,"	1
said	1
her	1
sister.	1
"My	1
dear	1
father,	1
I	1
congratulate	1
you."	1
"And	1
have	1
you	1
answered	1
the	1
letter?"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth.	1
"No;	1
but	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
done	1
soon."	1
Most	1
earnestly	1
did	1
she	1
then	1
entreaty	1
him	1
to	1
lose	1
no	1
more	1
time	1
before	1
he	1
wrote.	1
"Oh!	1
my	1
dear	1
father,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
"come	1
back	1
and	1
write	1
immediately.	1
Consider	1
how	1
important	1
every	1
moment	1
is	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
case."	1
"Let	1
me	1
write	1
for	1
you,"	1
said	1
Jane,	1
"if	1
you	1
dislike	1
the	1
trouble	1
yourself."	1
"I	1
dislike	1
it	1
very	1
much,"	1
he	1
replied;	1
"but	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
done."	1
And	1
so	1
saying,	1
he	1
turned	1
back	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
walked	1
towards	1
the	1
house.	1
"And	1
may	1
I	1
ask--"	1
said	1
Elizabeth;	1
"but	1
the	1
terms,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
must	1
be	1
complied	1
with."	1
"Complied	1
with!	1
I	1
am	1
only	1
ashamed	1
of	1
his	1
asking	1
so	1
little."	1
"And	1
they	1
_must_	1
marry!	1
Yet	1
he	1
is	1
_such_	1
a	1
man!"	1
"Yes,	1
yes,	1
they	1
must	1
marry.	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
be	1
done.	1
But	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
want	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
know;	1
one	1
is,	1
how	1
much	1
money	1
your	1
uncle	1
has	1
laid	1
down	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
about;	1
and	1
the	1
other,	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
ever	1
to	1
pay	1
him."	1
"Money!	1
My	1
uncle!"	1
cried	1
Jane,	1
"what	1
do	1
you	1
mean,	1
sir?"	1
"I	1
mean,	1
that	1
no	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
senses	1
would	1
marry	1
Lydia	1
on	1
so	1
slight	1
a	1
temptation	1
as	1
one	1
hundred	1
a	1
year	1
during	1
my	1
life,	1
and	1
fifty	1
after	1
I	1
am	1
gone."	1
"That	1
is	1
very	1
true,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth;	1
"though	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
before.	1
His	1
debts	1
to	1
be	1
discharged,	1
and	1
something	1
still	1
to	1
remain!	1
Oh!	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
my	1
uncle's	1
doings!	1
Generous,	1
good	1
man,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
he	1
has	1
distressed	1
himself.	1
A	1
small	1
sum	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
all	1
this."	1
"No,"	1
said	1
her	1
father;	1
"Wickham's	1
a	1
fool	1
if	1
he	1
takes	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
farthing	1
less	1
than	1
ten	1
thousand	1
pounds.	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
sorry	1
to	1
think	1
so	1
ill	1
of	1
him,	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
beginning	1
of	1
our	1
relationship."	1
"Ten	1
thousand	1
pounds!	1
Heaven	1
forbid!	1
How	1
is	1
half	1
such	1
a	1
sum	1
to	1
be	1
repaid?"	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
made	1
no	1
answer,	1
and	1
each	1
of	1
them,	1
deep	1
in	1
thought,	1
continued	1
silent	1
till	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
house.	1
Their	1
father	1
then	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
library	1
to	1
write,	1
and	1
the	1
girls	1
walked	1
into	1
the	1
breakfast-room.	1
"And	1
they	1
are	1
really	1
to	1
be	1
married!"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
by	1
themselves.	1
"How	1
strange	1
this	1
is!	1
And	1
for	1
_this_	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
thankful.	1
That	1
they	1
should	1
marry,	1
small	1
as	1
is	1
their	1
chance	1
of	1
happiness,	1
and	1
wretched	1
as	1
is	1
his	1
character,	1
we	1
are	1
forced	1
to	1
rejoice.	1
Oh,	1
Lydia!"	1
"I	1
comfort	1
myself	1
with	1
thinking,"	1
replied	1
Jane,	1
"that	1
he	1
certainly	1
would	1
not	1
marry	1
Lydia	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
real	1
regard	1
for	1
her.	1
Though	1
our	1
kind	1
uncle	1
has	1
done	1
something	1
towards	1
clearing	1
him,	1
I	1
cannot	1
believe	1
that	1
ten	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
or	1
anything	1
like	1
it,	1
has	1
been	1
advanced.	1
He	1
has	1
children	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
may	1
have	1
more.	1
How	1
could	1
he	1
spare	1
half	1
ten	1
thousand	1
pounds?"	1
"If	1
he	1
were	1
ever	1
able	1
to	1
learn	1
what	1
Wickham's	1
debts	1
have	1
been,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
"and	1
how	1
much	1
is	1
settled	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
on	1
our	1
sister,	1
we	1
shall	1
exactly	1
know	1
what	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
has	1
done	1
for	1
them,	1
because	1
Wickham	1
has	1
not	1
sixpence	1
of	1
his	1
own.	1
The	1
kindness	1
of	1
my	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
requited.	1
Their	1
taking	1
her	1
home,	1
and	1
affording	1
her	1
their	1
personal	1
protection	1
and	1
countenance,	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
sacrifice	1
to	1
her	1
advantage	1
as	1
years	1
of	1
gratitude	1
cannot	1
enough	1
acknowledge.	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
she	1
is	1
actually	1
with	1
them!	1
If	1
such	1
goodness	1
does	1
not	1
make	1
her	1
miserable	1
now,	1
she	1
will	1
never	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
happy!	1
What	1
a	1
meeting	1
for	1
her,	1
when	1
she	1
first	1
sees	1
my	1
aunt!"	1
"We	1
must	1
endeavour	1
to	1
forget	1
all	1
that	1
has	1
passed	1
on	1
either	1
side,"	1
said	1
Jane:	1
"I	1
hope	1
and	1
trust	1
they	1
will	1
yet	1
be	1
happy.	1
His	1
consenting	1
to	1
marry	1
her	1
is	1
a	1
proof,	1
I	1
will	1
believe,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
right	1
way	1
of	1
thinking.	1
Their	1
mutual	1
affection	1
will	1
steady	1
them;	1
and	1
I	1
flatter	1
myself	1
they	1
will	1
settle	1
so	1
quietly,	1
and	1
live	1
in	1
so	1
rational	1
a	1
manner,	1
as	1
may	1
in	1
time	1
make	1
their	1
past	1
imprudence	1
forgotten."	1
"Their	1
conduct	1
has	1
been	1
such,"	1
replied	1
Elizabeth,	1
"as	1
neither	1
you,	1
nor	1
I,	1
nor	1
anybody	1
can	1
ever	1
forget.	1
It	1
is	1
useless	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
it."	1
It	1
now	1
occurred	1
to	1
the	1
girls	1
that	1
their	1
mother	1
was	1
in	1
all	1
likelihood	1
perfectly	1
ignorant	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
happened.	1
They	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
library,	1
therefore,	1
and	1
asked	1
their	1
father	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
wish	1
them	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
known	1
to	1
her.	1
He	1
was	1
writing	1
and,	1
without	1
raising	1
his	1
head,	1
coolly	1
replied:	1
"Just	1
as	1
you	1
please."	1
"May	1
we	1
take	1
my	1
uncle's	1
letter	1
to	1
read	1
to	1
her?"	1
"Take	1
whatever	1
you	1
like,	1
and	1
get	1
away."	1
Elizabeth	1
took	1
the	1
letter	1
from	1
his	1
writing-table,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
up	1
stairs	1
together.	1
Mary	1
and	1
Kitty	1
were	1
both	1
with	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet:	1
one	1
communication	1
would,	1
therefore,	1
do	1
for	1
all.	1
After	1
a	1
slight	1
preparation	1
for	1
good	1
news,	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
read	1
aloud.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
could	1
hardly	1
contain	1
herself.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Jane	1
had	1
read	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner's	1
hope	1
of	1
Lydia's	1
being	1
soon	1
married,	1
her	1
joy	1
burst	1
forth,	1
and	1
every	1
following	1
sentence	1
added	1
to	1
its	1
exuberance.	1
She	1
was	1
now	1
in	1
an	1
irritation	1
as	1
violent	1
from	1
delight,	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
fidgety	1
from	1
alarm	1
and	1
vexation.	1
To	1
know	1
that	1
her	1
daughter	1
would	1
be	1
married	1
was	1
enough.	1
She	1
was	1
disturbed	1
by	1
no	1
fear	1
for	1
her	1
felicity,	1
nor	1
humbled	1
by	1
any	1
remembrance	1
of	1
her	1
misconduct.	1
"My	1
dear,	1
dear	1
Lydia!"	1
she	1
cried.	1
"This	1
is	1
delightful	1
indeed!	1
She	1
will	1
be	1
married!	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
her	1
again!	1
She	1
will	1
be	1
married	1
at	1
sixteen!	1
My	1
good,	1
kind	1
brother!	1
I	1
knew	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be.	1
I	1
knew	1
he	1
would	1
manage	1
everything!	1
How	1
I	1
long	1
to	1
see	1
her!	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
dear	1
Wickham	1
too!	1
But	1
the	1
clothes,	1
the	1
wedding	1
clothes!	1
I	1
will	1
write	1
to	1
my	1
sister	1
Gardiner	1
about	1
them	1
directly.	1
Lizzy,	1
my	1
dear,	1
run	1
down	1
to	1
your	1
father,	1
and	1
ask	1
him	1
how	1
much	1
he	1
will	1
give	1
her.	1
Stay,	1
stay,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
myself.	1
Ring	1
the	1
bell,	1
Kitty,	1
for	1
Hill.	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
on	1
my	1
things	1
in	1
a	1
moment.	1
My	1
dear,	1
dear	1
Lydia!	1
How	1
merry	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
together	1
when	1
we	1
meet!"	1
Her	1
eldest	1
daughter	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
give	1
some	1
relief	1
to	1
the	1
violence	1
of	1
these	1
transports,	1
by	1
leading	1
her	1
thoughts	1
to	1
the	1
obligations	1
which	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner's	1
behaviour	1
laid	1
them	1
all	1
under.	1
"For	1
we	1
must	1
attribute	1
this	1
happy	1
conclusion,"	1
she	1
added,	1
"in	1
a	1
great	1
measure	1
to	1
his	1
kindness.	1
We	1
are	1
persuaded	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
pledged	1
himself	1
to	1
assist	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
with	1
money."	1
"Well,"	1
cried	1
her	1
mother,	1
"it	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
right;	1
who	1
should	1
do	1
it	1
but	1
her	1
own	1
uncle?	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
a	1
family	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
children	1
must	1
have	1
had	1
all	1
his	1
money,	1
you	1
know;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
we	1
have	1
ever	1
had	1
anything	1
from	1
him,	1
except	1
a	1
few	1
presents.	1
Well!	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
happy!	1
In	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
a	1
daughter	1
married.	1
Mrs.	1
Wickham!	1
How	1
well	1
it	1
sounds!	1
And	1
she	1
was	1
only	1
sixteen	1
last	1
June.	1
My	1
dear	1
Jane,	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
flutter,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
can't	1
write;	1
so	1
I	1
will	1
dictate,	1
and	1
you	1
write	1
for	1
me.	1
We	1
will	1
settle	1
with	1
your	1
father	1
about	1
the	1
money	1
afterwards;	1
but	1
the	1
things	1
should	1
be	1
ordered	1
immediately."	1
She	1
was	1
then	1
proceeding	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
calico,	1
muslin,	1
and	1
cambric,	1
and	1
would	1
shortly	1
have	1
dictated	1
some	1
very	1
plentiful	1
orders,	1
had	1
not	1
Jane,	1
though	1
with	1
some	1
difficulty,	1
persuaded	1
her	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
her	1
father	1
was	1
at	1
leisure	1
to	1
be	1
consulted.	1
One	1
day's	1
delay,	1
she	1
observed,	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
small	1
importance;	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
too	1
happy	1
to	1
be	1
quite	1
so	1
obstinate	1
as	1
usual.	1
Other	1
schemes,	1
too,	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
head.	1
"I	1
will	1
go	1
to	1
Meryton,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
dressed,	1
and	1
tell	1
the	1
good,	1
good	1
news	1
to	1
my	1
sister	1
Philips.	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
come	1
back,	1
I	1
can	1
call	1
on	1
Lady	1
Lucas	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Long.	1
Kitty,	1
run	1
down	1
and	1
order	1
the	1
carriage.	1
An	1
airing	1
would	1
do	1
me	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
good,	1
I	1
am	1
sure.	1
Girls,	1
can	1
I	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
you	1
in	1
Meryton?	1
Oh!	1
Here	1
comes	1
Hill!	1
My	1
dear	1
Hill,	1
have	1
you	1
heard	1
the	1
good	1
news?	1
Miss	1
Lydia	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
married;	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
all	1
have	1
a	1
bowl	1
of	1
punch	1
to	1
make	1
merry	1
at	1
her	1
wedding."	1
Mrs.	1
Hill	1
began	1
instantly	1
to	1
express	1
her	1
joy.	1
Elizabeth	1
received	1
her	1
congratulations	1
amongst	1
the	1
rest,	1
and	1
then,	1
sick	1
of	1
this	1
folly,	1
took	1
refuge	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
room,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
think	1
with	1
freedom.	1
Poor	1
Lydia's	1
situation	1
must,	1
at	1
best,	1
be	1
bad	1
enough;	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
worse,	1
she	1
had	1
need	1
to	1
be	1
thankful.	1
She	1
felt	1
it	1
so;	1
and	1
though,	1
in	1
looking	1
forward,	1
neither	1
rational	1
happiness	1
nor	1
worldly	1
prosperity	1
could	1
be	1
justly	1
expected	1
for	1
her	1
sister,	1
in	1
looking	1
back	1
to	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
feared,	1
only	1
two	1
hours	1
ago,	1
she	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
gained.	1
Chapter	1
50	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
had	1
very	1
often	1
wished	1
before	1
this	1
period	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
that,	1
instead	1
of	1
spending	1
his	1
whole	1
income,	1
he	1
had	1
laid	1
by	1
an	1
annual	1
sum	1
for	1
the	1
better	1
provision	1
of	1
his	1
children,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
if	1
she	1
survived	1
him.	1
He	1
now	1
wished	1
it	1
more	1
than	1
ever.	1
Had	1
he	1
done	1
his	1
duty	1
in	1
that	1
respect,	1
Lydia	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
indebted	1
to	1
her	1
uncle	1
for	1
whatever	1
of	1
honour	1
or	1
credit	1
could	1
now	1
be	1
purchased	1
for	1
her.	1
The	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
prevailing	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
worthless	1
young	1
men	1
in	1
Great	1
Britain	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
husband	1
might	1
then	1
have	1
rested	1
in	1
its	1
proper	1
place.	1
He	1
was	1
seriously	1
concerned	1
that	1
a	1
cause	1
of	1
so	1
little	1
advantage	1
to	1
anyone	1
should	1
be	1
forwarded	1
at	1
the	1
sole	1
expense	1
of	1
his	1
brother-in-law,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
determined,	1
if	1
possible,	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
his	1
assistance,	1
and	1
to	1
discharge	1
the	1
obligation	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
could.	1
When	1
first	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
had	1
married,	1
economy	1
was	1
held	1
to	1
be	1
perfectly	1
useless,	1
for,	1
of	1
course,	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
son.	1
The	1
son	1
was	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
cutting	1
off	1
the	1
entail,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
of	1
age,	1
and	1
the	1
widow	1
and	1
younger	1
children	1
would	1
by	1
that	1
means	1
be	1
provided	1
for.	1
Five	1
daughters	1
successively	1
entered	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
yet	1
the	1
son	1
was	1
to	1
come;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
after	1
Lydia's	1
birth,	1
had	1
been	1
certain	1
that	1
he	1
would.	1
This	1
event	1
had	1
at	1
last	1
been	1
despaired	1
of,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
too	1
late	1
to	1
be	1
saving.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
had	1
no	1
turn	1
for	1
economy,	1
and	1
her	1
husband's	1
love	1
of	1
independence	1
had	1
alone	1
prevented	1
their	1
exceeding	1
their	1
income.	1
Five	1
thousand	1
pounds	1
was	1
settled	1
by	1
marriage	1
articles	1
on	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
and	1
the	1
children.	1
But	1
in	1
what	1
proportions	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
divided	1
amongst	1
the	1
latter	1
depended	1
on	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
parents.	1
This	1
was	1
one	1
point,	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
Lydia,	1
at	1
least,	1
which	1
was	1
now	1
to	1
be	1
settled,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
hesitation	1
in	1
acceding	1
to	1
the	1
proposal	1
before	1
him.	1
In	1
terms	1
of	1
grateful	1
acknowledgment	1
for	1
the	1
kindness	1
of	1
his	1
brother,	1
though	1
expressed	1
most	1
concisely,	1
he	1
then	1
delivered	1
on	1
paper	1
his	1
perfect	1
approbation	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
done,	1
and	1
his	1
willingness	1
to	1
fulfil	1
the	1
engagements	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
for	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
supposed	1
that,	1
could	1
Wickham	1
be	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
marry	1
his	1
daughter,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
so	1
little	1
inconvenience	1
to	1
himself	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
present	1
arrangement.	1
He	1
would	1
scarcely	1
be	1
ten	1
pounds	1
a	1
year	1
the	1
loser	1
by	1
the	1
hundred	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
them;	1
for,	1
what	1
with	1
her	1
board	1
and	1
pocket	1
allowance,	1
and	1
the	1
continual	1
presents	1
in	1
money	1
which	1
passed	1
to	1
her	1
through	1
her	1
mother's	1
hands,	1
Lydia's	1
expenses	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
little	1
within	1
that	1
sum.	1
That	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
such	1
trifling	1
exertion	1
on	1
his	1
side,	1
too,	1
was	1
another	1
very	1
welcome	1
surprise;	1
for	1
his	1
wish	1
at	1
present	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
as	1
little	1
trouble	1
in	1
the	1
business	1
as	1
possible.	1
When	1
the	1
first	1
transports	1
of	1
rage	1
which	1
had	1
produced	1
his	1
activity	1
in	1
seeking	1
her	1
were	1
over,	1
he	1
naturally	1
returned	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
former	1
indolence.	1
His	1
letter	1
was	1
soon	1
dispatched;	1
for,	1
though	1
dilatory	1
in	1
undertaking	1
business,	1
he	1
was	1
quick	1
in	1
its	1
execution.	1
He	1
begged	1
to	1
know	1
further	1
particulars	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
indebted	1
to	1
his	1
brother,	1
but	1
was	1
too	1
angry	1
with	1
Lydia	1
to	1
send	1
any	1
message	1
to	1
her.	1
The	1
good	1
news	1
spread	1
quickly	1
through	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
with	1
proportionate	1
speed	1
through	1
the	1
neighbourhood.	1
It	1
was	1
borne	1
in	1
the	1
latter	1
with	1
decent	1
philosophy.	1
To	1
be	1
sure,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
for	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
conversation	1
had	1
Miss	1
Lydia	1
Bennet	1
come	1
upon	1
the	1
town;	1
or,	1
as	1
the	1
happiest	1
alternative,	1
been	1
secluded	1
from	1
the	1
world,	1
in	1
some	1
distant	1
farmhouse.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
talked	1
of	1
in	1
marrying	1
her;	1
and	1
the	1
good-natured	1
wishes	1
for	1
her	1
well-doing	1
which	1
had	1
proceeded	1
before	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
spiteful	1
old	1
ladies	1
in	1
Meryton	1
lost	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
their	1
spirit	1
in	1
this	1
change	1
of	1
circumstances,	1
because	1
with	1
such	1
an	1
husband	1
her	1
misery	1
was	1
considered	1
certain.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
fortnight	1
since	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
had	1
been	1
downstairs;	1
but	1
on	1
this	1
happy	1
day	1
she	1
again	1
took	1
her	1
seat	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
her	1
table,	1
and	1
in	1
spirits	1
oppressively	1
high.	1
No	1
sentiment	1
of	1
shame	1
gave	1
a	1
damp	1
to	1
her	1
triumph.	1
The	1
marriage	1
of	1
a	1
daughter,	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
first	1
object	1
of	1
her	1
wishes	1
since	1
Jane	1
was	1
sixteen,	1
was	1
now	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
accomplishment,	1
and	1
her	1
thoughts	1
and	1
her	1
words	1
ran	1
wholly	1
on	1
those	1
attendants	1
of	1
elegant	1
nuptials,	1
fine	1
muslins,	1
new	1
carriages,	1
and	1
servants.	1
She	1
was	1
busily	1
searching	1
through	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
for	1
a	1
proper	1
situation	1
for	1
her	1
daughter,	1
and,	1
without	1
knowing	1
or	1
considering	1
what	1
their	1
income	1
might	1
be,	1
rejected	1
many	1
as	1
deficient	1
in	1
size	1
and	1
importance.	1
"Haye	1
Park	1
might	1
do,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"if	1
the	1
Gouldings	1
could	1
quit	1
it--or	1
the	1
great	1
house	1
at	1
Stoke,	1
if	1
the	1
drawing-room	1
were	1
larger;	1
but	1
Ashworth	1
is	1
too	1
far	1
off!	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
ten	1
miles	1
from	1
me;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
Pulvis	1
Lodge,	1
the	1
attics	1
are	1
dreadful."	1
Her	1
husband	1
allowed	1
her	1
to	1
talk	1
on	1
without	1
interruption	1
while	1
the	1
servants	1
remained.	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
withdrawn,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her:	1
"Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
before	1
you	1
take	1
any	1
or	1
all	1
of	1
these	1
houses	1
for	1
your	1
son	1
and	1
daughter,	1
let	1
us	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
right	1
understanding.	1
Into	1
_one_	1
house	1
in	1
this	1
neighbourhood	1
they	1
shall	1
never	1
have	1
admittance.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
encourage	1
the	1
impudence	1
of	1
either,	1
by	1
receiving	1
them	1
at	1
Longbourn."	1
A	1
long	1
dispute	1
followed	1
this	1
declaration;	1
but	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
firm.	1
It	1
soon	1
led	1
to	1
another;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
found,	1
with	1
amazement	1
and	1
horror,	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
would	1
not	1
advance	1
a	1
guinea	1
to	1
buy	1
clothes	1
for	1
his	1
daughter.	1
He	1
protested	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
receive	1
from	1
him	1
no	1
mark	1
of	1
affection	1
whatever	1
on	1
the	1
occasion.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
could	1
hardly	1
comprehend	1
it.	1
That	1
his	1
anger	1
could	1
be	1
carried	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
inconceivable	1
resentment	1
as	1
to	1
refuse	1
his	1
daughter	1
a	1
privilege	1
without	1
which	1
her	1
marriage	1
would	1
scarcely	1
seem	1
valid,	1
exceeded	1
all	1
she	1
could	1
believe	1
possible.	1
She	1
was	1
more	1
alive	1
to	1
the	1
disgrace	1
which	1
her	1
want	1
of	1
new	1
clothes	1
must	1
reflect	1
on	1
her	1
daughter's	1
nuptials,	1
than	1
to	1
any	1
sense	1
of	1
shame	1
at	1
her	1
eloping	1
and	1
living	1
with	1
Wickham	1
a	1
fortnight	1
before	1
they	1
took	1
place.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
now	1
most	1
heartily	1
sorry	1
that	1
she	1
had,	1
from	1
the	1
distress	1
of	1
the	1
moment,	1
been	1
led	1
to	1
make	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
acquainted	1
with	1
their	1
fears	1
for	1
her	1
sister;	1
for	1
since	1
her	1
marriage	1
would	1
so	1
shortly	1
give	1
the	1
proper	1
termination	1
to	1
the	1
elopement,	1
they	1
might	1
hope	1
to	1
conceal	1
its	1
unfavourable	1
beginning	1
from	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
immediately	1
on	1
the	1
spot.	1
She	1
had	1
no	1
fear	1
of	1
its	1
spreading	1
farther	1
through	1
his	1
means.	1
There	1
were	1
few	1
people	1
on	1
whose	1
secrecy	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
more	1
confidently	1
depended;	1
but,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
whose	1
knowledge	1
of	1
a	1
sister's	1
frailty	1
would	1
have	1
mortified	1
her	1
so	1
much--not,	1
however,	1
from	1
any	1
fear	1
of	1
disadvantage	1
from	1
it	1
individually	1
to	1
herself,	1
for,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
there	1
seemed	1
a	1
gulf	1
impassable	1
between	1
them.	1
Had	1
Lydia's	1
marriage	1
been	1
concluded	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
honourable	1
terms,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
would	1
connect	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
family	1
where,	1
to	1
every	1
other	1
objection,	1
would	1
now	1
be	1
added	1
an	1
alliance	1
and	1
relationship	1
of	1
the	1
nearest	1
kind	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
whom	1
he	1
so	1
justly	1
scorned.	1
From	1
such	1
a	1
connection	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
wonder	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
shrink.	1
The	1
wish	1
of	1
procuring	1
her	1
regard,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
assured	1
herself	1
of	1
his	1
feeling	1
in	1
Derbyshire,	1
could	1
not	1
in	1
rational	1
expectation	1
survive	1
such	1
a	1
blow	1
as	1
this.	1
She	1
was	1
humbled,	1
she	1
was	1
grieved;	1
she	1
repented,	1
though	1
she	1
hardly	1
knew	1
of	1
what.	1
She	1
became	1
jealous	1
of	1
his	1
esteem,	1
when	1
she	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
hope	1
to	1
be	1
benefited	1
by	1
it.	1
She	1
wanted	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
him,	1
when	1
there	1
seemed	1
the	1
least	1
chance	1
of	1
gaining	1
intelligence.	1
She	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
happy	1
with	1
him,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
likely	1
they	1
should	1
meet.	1
What	1
a	1
triumph	1
for	1
him,	1
as	1
she	1
often	1
thought,	1
could	1
he	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
proposals	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
proudly	1
spurned	1
only	1
four	1
months	1
ago,	1
would	1
now	1
have	1
been	1
most	1
gladly	1
and	1
gratefully	1
received!	1
He	1
was	1
as	1
generous,	1
she	1
doubted	1
not,	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
generous	1
of	1
his	1
sex;	1
but	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
mortal,	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
triumph.	1
She	1
began	1
now	1
to	1
comprehend	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
exactly	1
the	1
man	1
who,	1
in	1
disposition	1
and	1
talents,	1
would	1
most	1
suit	1
her.	1
His	1
understanding	1
and	1
temper,	1
though	1
unlike	1
her	1
own,	1
would	1
have	1
answered	1
all	1
her	1
wishes.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
union	1
that	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
to	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
both;	1
by	1
her	1
ease	1
and	1
liveliness,	1
his	1
mind	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
softened,	1
his	1
manners	1
improved;	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
judgement,	1
information,	1
and	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
received	1
benefit	1
of	1
greater	1
importance.	1
But	1
no	1
such	1
happy	1
marriage	1
could	1
now	1
teach	1
the	1
admiring	1
multitude	1
what	1
connubial	1
felicity	1
really	1
was.	1
An	1
union	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
tendency,	1
and	1
precluding	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
the	1
other,	1
was	1
soon	1
to	1
be	1
formed	1
in	1
their	1
family.	1
How	1
Wickham	1
and	1
Lydia	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
supported	1
in	1
tolerable	1
independence,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
imagine.	1
But	1
how	1
little	1
of	1
permanent	1
happiness	1
could	1
belong	1
to	1
a	1
couple	1
who	1
were	1
only	1
brought	1
together	1
because	1
their	1
passions	1
were	1
stronger	1
than	1
their	1
virtue,	1
she	1
could	1
easily	1
conjecture.	1

Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
soon	1
wrote	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
brother.	1
To	1
Mr.	1
Bennet's	1
acknowledgments	1
he	1
briefly	1
replied,	1
with	1
assurance	1
of	1
his	1
eagerness	1
to	1
promote	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
family;	1
and	1
concluded	1
with	1
entreaties	1
that	1
the	1
subject	1
might	1
never	1
be	1
mentioned	1
to	1
him	1
again.	1
The	1
principal	1
purport	1
of	1
his	1
letter	1
was	1
to	1
inform	1
them	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
had	1
resolved	1
on	1
quitting	1
the	1
militia.	1
"It	1
was	1
greatly	1
my	1
wish	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
so,"	1
he	1
added,	1
"as	1
soon	1
as	1
his	1
marriage	1
was	1
fixed	1
on.	1
And	1
I	1
think	1
you	1
will	1
agree	1
with	1
me,	1
in	1
considering	1
the	1
removal	1
from	1
that	1
corps	1
as	1
highly	1
advisable,	1
both	1
on	1
his	1
account	1
and	1
my	1
niece's.	1
It	1
is	1
Mr.	1
Wickham's	1
intention	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
regulars;	1
and	1
among	1
his	1
former	1
friends,	1
there	1
are	1
still	1
some	1
who	1
are	1
able	1
and	1
willing	1
to	1
assist	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
army.	1
He	1
has	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
an	1
ensigncy	1
in	1
General	1
----'s	1
regiment,	1
now	1
quartered	1
in	1
the	1
North.	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
advantage	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
He	1
promises	1
fairly;	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
among	1
different	1
people,	1
where	1
they	1
may	1
each	1
have	1
a	1
character	1
to	1
preserve,	1
they	1
will	1
both	1
be	1
more	1
prudent.	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
to	1
Colonel	1
Forster,	1
to	1
inform	1
him	1
of	1
our	1
present	1
arrangements,	1
and	1
to	1
request	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
satisfy	1
the	1
various	1
creditors	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
in	1
and	1
near	1
Brighton,	1
with	1
assurances	1
of	1
speedy	1
payment,	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
pledged	1
myself.	1
And	1
will	1
you	1
give	1
yourself	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
carrying	1
similar	1
assurances	1
to	1
his	1
creditors	1
in	1
Meryton,	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
shall	1
subjoin	1
a	1
list	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
information?	1
He	1
has	1
given	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
debts;	1
I	1
hope	1
at	1
least	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
deceived	1
us.	1
Haggerston	1
has	1
our	1
directions,	1
and	1
all	1
will	1
be	1
completed	1
in	1
a	1
week.	1
They	1
will	1
then	1
join	1
his	1
regiment,	1
unless	1
they	1
are	1
first	1
invited	1
to	1
Longbourn;	1
and	1
I	1
understand	1
from	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner,	1
that	1
my	1
niece	1
is	1
very	1
desirous	1
of	1
seeing	1
you	1
all	1
before	1
she	1
leaves	1
the	1
South.	1
She	1
is	1
well,	1
and	1
begs	1
to	1
be	1
dutifully	1
remembered	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
mother.--Yours,	1
etc.,	1
"E.	1
GARDINER."	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
and	1
his	1
daughters	1
saw	1
all	1
the	1
advantages	1
of	1
Wickham's	1
removal	1
from	1
the	1
----shire	1
as	1
clearly	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
could	1
do.	1
But	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
well	1
pleased	1
with	1
it.	1
Lydia's	1
being	1
settled	1
in	1
the	1
North,	1
just	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
expected	1
most	1
pleasure	1
and	1
pride	1
in	1
her	1
company,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
given	1
up	1
her	1
plan	1
of	1
their	1
residing	1
in	1
Hertfordshire,	1
was	1
a	1
severe	1
disappointment;	1
and,	1
besides,	1
it	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
pity	1
that	1
Lydia	1
should	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
a	1
regiment	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
acquainted	1
with	1
everybody,	1
and	1
had	1
so	1
many	1
favourites.	1
"She	1
is	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Forster,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"it	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
shocking	1
to	1
send	1
her	1
away!	1
And	1
there	1
are	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
men,	1
too,	1
that	1
she	1
likes	1
very	1
much.	1
The	1
officers	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
pleasant	1
in	1
General	1
----'s	1
regiment."	1
His	1
daughter's	1
request,	1
for	1
such	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
considered,	1
of	1
being	1
admitted	1
into	1
her	1
family	1
again	1
before	1
she	1
set	1
off	1
for	1
the	1
North,	1
received	1
at	1
first	1
an	1
absolute	1
negative.	1
But	1
Jane	1
and	1
Elizabeth,	1
who	1
agreed	1
in	1
wishing,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
their	1
sister's	1
feelings	1
and	1
consequence,	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
noticed	1
on	1
her	1
marriage	1
by	1
her	1
parents,	1
urged	1
him	1
so	1
earnestly	1
yet	1
so	1
rationally	1
and	1
so	1
mildly,	1
to	1
receive	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
at	1
Longbourn,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
married,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
think	1
as	1
they	1
thought,	1
and	1
act	1
as	1
they	1
wished.	1
And	1
their	1
mother	1
had	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
knowing	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
married	1
daughter	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
before	1
she	1
was	1
banished	1
to	1
the	1
North.	1
When	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
wrote	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
brother,	1
therefore,	1
he	1
sent	1
his	1
permission	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
come;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
settled,	1
that	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
ceremony	1
was	1
over,	1
they	1
should	1
proceed	1
to	1
Longbourn.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
surprised,	1
however,	1
that	1
Wickham	1
should	1
consent	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
scheme,	1
and	1
had	1
she	1
consulted	1
only	1
her	1
own	1
inclination,	1
any	1
meeting	1
with	1
him	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
last	1
object	1
of	1
her	1
wishes.	1
Chapter	1
51	1
Their	1
sister's	1
wedding	1
day	1
arrived;	1
and	1
Jane	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
felt	1
for	1
her	1
probably	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
felt	1
for	1
herself.	1
The	1
carriage	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
meet	1
them	1
at	1
----,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
return	1
in	1
it	1
by	1
dinner-time.	1
Their	1
arrival	1
was	1
dreaded	1
by	1
the	1
elder	1
Miss	1
Bennets,	1
and	1
Jane	1
more	1
especially,	1
who	1
gave	1
Lydia	1
the	1
feelings	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
attended	1
herself,	1
had	1
she	1
been	1
the	1
culprit,	1
and	1
was	1
wretched	1
in	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
her	1
sister	1
must	1
endure.	1
They	1
came.	1
The	1
family	1
were	1
assembled	1
in	1
the	1
breakfast	1
room	1
to	1
receive	1
them.	1
Smiles	1
decked	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
as	1
the	1
carriage	1
drove	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
door;	1
her	1
husband	1
looked	1
impenetrably	1
grave;	1
her	1
daughters,	1
alarmed,	1
anxious,	1
uneasy.	1
Lydia's	1
voice	1
was	1
heard	1
in	1
the	1
vestibule;	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
thrown	1
open,	1
and	1
she	1
ran	1
into	1
the	1
room.	1
Her	1
mother	1
stepped	1
forwards,	1
embraced	1
her,	1
and	1
welcomed	1
her	1
with	1
rapture;	1
gave	1
her	1
hand,	1
with	1
an	1
affectionate	1
smile,	1
to	1
Wickham,	1
who	1
followed	1
his	1
lady;	1
and	1
wished	1
them	1
both	1
joy	1
with	1
an	1
alacrity	1
which	1
shewed	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
their	1
happiness.	1
Their	1
reception	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
then	1
turned,	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
cordial.	1
His	1
countenance	1
rather	1
gained	1
in	1
austerity;	1
and	1
he	1
scarcely	1
opened	1
his	1
lips.	1
The	1
easy	1
assurance	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
couple,	1
indeed,	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
provoke	1
him.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
disgusted,	1
and	1
even	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
was	1
shocked.	1
Lydia	1
was	1
Lydia	1
still;	1
untamed,	1
unabashed,	1
wild,	1
noisy,	1
and	1
fearless.	1
She	1
turned	1
from	1
sister	1
to	1
sister,	1
demanding	1
their	1
congratulations;	1
and	1
when	1
at	1
length	1
they	1
all	1
sat	1
down,	1
looked	1
eagerly	1
round	1
the	1
room,	1
took	1
notice	1
of	1
some	1
little	1
alteration	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
observed,	1
with	1
a	1
laugh,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
while	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
there.	1
Wickham	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
more	1
distressed	1
than	1
herself,	1
but	1
his	1
manners	1
were	1
always	1
so	1
pleasing,	1
that	1
had	1
his	1
character	1
and	1
his	1
marriage	1
been	1
exactly	1
what	1
they	1
ought,	1
his	1
smiles	1
and	1
his	1
easy	1
address,	1
while	1
he	1
claimed	1
their	1
relationship,	1
would	1
have	1
delighted	1
them	1
all.	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
not	1
before	1
believed	1
him	1
quite	1
equal	1
to	1
such	1
assurance;	1
but	1
she	1
sat	1
down,	1
resolving	1
within	1
herself	1
to	1
draw	1
no	1
limits	1
in	1
future	1
to	1
the	1
impudence	1
of	1
an	1
impudent	1
man.	1
She	1
blushed,	1
and	1
Jane	1
blushed;	1
but	1
the	1
cheeks	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
who	1
caused	1
their	1
confusion	1
suffered	1
no	1
variation	1
of	1
colour.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
discourse.	1
The	1
bride	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
could	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
talk	1
fast	1
enough;	1
and	1
Wickham,	1
who	1
happened	1
to	1
sit	1
near	1
Elizabeth,	1
began	1
inquiring	1
after	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
in	1
that	1
neighbourhood,	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
humoured	1
ease	1
which	1
she	1
felt	1
very	1
unable	1
to	1
equal	1
in	1
her	1
replies.	1
They	1
seemed	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
happiest	1
memories	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Nothing	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
was	1
recollected	1
with	1
pain;	1
and	1
Lydia	1
led	1
voluntarily	1
to	1
subjects	1
which	1
her	1
sisters	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
alluded	1
to	1
for	1
the	1
world.	1
"Only	1
think	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
three	1
months,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
"since	1
I	1
went	1
away;	1
it	1
seems	1
but	1
a	1
fortnight	1
I	1
declare;	1
and	1
yet	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
things	1
enough	1
happened	1
in	1
the	1
time.	1
Good	1
gracious!	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
away,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
idea	1
of	1
being	1
married	1
till	1
I	1
came	1
back	1
again!	1
though	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
good	1
fun	1
if	1
I	1
was."	1
Her	1
father	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Jane	1
was	1
distressed.	1
Elizabeth	1
looked	1
expressively	1
at	1
Lydia;	1
but	1
she,	1
who	1
never	1
heard	1
nor	1
saw	1
anything	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
chose	1
to	1
be	1
insensible,	1
gaily	1
continued,	1
"Oh!	1
mamma,	1
do	1
the	1
people	1
hereabouts	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
married	1
to-day?	1
I	1
was	1
afraid	1
they	1
might	1
not;	1
and	1
we	1
overtook	1
William	1
Goulding	1
in	1
his	1
curricle,	1
so	1
I	1
was	1
determined	1
he	1
should	1
know	1
it,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
let	1
down	1
the	1
side-glass	1
next	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
off	1
my	1
glove,	1
and	1
let	1
my	1
hand	1
just	1
rest	1
upon	1
the	1
window	1
frame,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
see	1
the	1
ring,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
bowed	1
and	1
smiled	1
like	1
anything."	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
bear	1
it	1
no	1
longer.	1
She	1
got	1
up,	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room;	1
and	1
returned	1
no	1
more,	1
till	1
she	1
heard	1
them	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
hall	1
to	1
the	1
dining	1
parlour.	1
She	1
then	1
joined	1
them	1
soon	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
Lydia,	1
with	1
anxious	1
parade,	1
walk	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
mother's	1
right	1
hand,	1
and	1
hear	1
her	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
eldest	1
sister,	1
"Ah!	1
Jane,	1
I	1
take	1
your	1
place	1
now,	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
go	1
lower,	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
married	1
woman."	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
time	1
would	1
give	1
Lydia	1
that	1
embarrassment	1
from	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
wholly	1
free	1
at	1
first.	1
Her	1
ease	1
and	1
good	1
spirits	1
increased.	1
She	1
longed	1
to	1
see	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips,	1
the	1
Lucases,	1
and	1
all	1
their	1
other	1
neighbours,	1
and	1
to	1
hear	1
herself	1
called	1
"Mrs.	1
Wickham"	1
by	1
each	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
mean	1
time,	1
she	1
went	1
after	1
dinner	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
ring,	1
and	1
boast	1
of	1
being	1
married,	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Hill	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
housemaids.	1
"Well,	1
mamma,"	1
said	1
she,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
breakfast	1
room,	1
"and	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
my	1
husband?	1
Is	1
not	1
he	1
a	1
charming	1
man?	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
my	1
sisters	1
must	1
all	1
envy	1
me.	1
I	1
only	1
hope	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
half	1
my	1
good	1
luck.	1
They	1
must	1
all	1
go	1
to	1
Brighton.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
to	1
get	1
husbands.	1
What	1
a	1
pity	1
it	1
is,	1
mamma,	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
all	1
go."	1
"Very	1
true;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
my	1
will,	1
we	1
should.	1
But	1
my	1
dear	1
Lydia,	1
I	1
don't	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
your	1
going	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
off.	1
Must	1
it	1
be	1
so?"	1
"Oh,	1
lord!	1
yes;--there	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
that.	1
I	1
shall	1
like	1
it	1
of	1
all	1
things.	1
You	1
and	1
papa,	1
and	1
my	1
sisters,	1
must	1
come	1
down	1
and	1
see	1
us.	1
We	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
Newcastle	1
all	1
the	1
winter,	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
some	1
balls,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
get	1
good	1
partners	1
for	1
them	1
all."	1
"I	1
should	1
like	1
it	1
beyond	1
anything!"	1
said	1
her	1
mother.	1
"And	1
then	1
when	1
you	1
go	1
away,	1
you	1
may	1
leave	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
my	1
sisters	1
behind	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
I	1
shall	1
get	1
husbands	1
for	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
winter	1
is	1
over."	1
"I	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
my	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
favour,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth;	1
"but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
particularly	1
like	1
your	1
way	1
of	1
getting	1
husbands."	1
Their	1
visitors	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
remain	1
above	1
ten	1
days	1
with	1
them.	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
had	1
received	1
his	1
commission	1
before	1
he	1
left	1
London,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
join	1
his	1
regiment	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
fortnight.	1
No	1
one	1
but	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
regretted	1
that	1
their	1
stay	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
short;	1
and	1
she	1
made	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
by	1
visiting	1
about	1
with	1
her	1
daughter,	1
and	1
having	1
very	1
frequent	1
parties	1
at	1
home.	1
These	1
parties	1
were	1
acceptable	1
to	1
all;	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
family	1
circle	1
was	1
even	1
more	1
desirable	1
to	1
such	1
as	1
did	1
think,	1
than	1
such	1
as	1
did	1
not.	1
Wickham's	1
affection	1
for	1
Lydia	1
was	1
just	1
what	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
it;	1
not	1
equal	1
to	1
Lydia's	1
for	1
him.	1
She	1
had	1
scarcely	1
needed	1
her	1
present	1
observation	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied,	1
from	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
things,	1
that	1
their	1
elopement	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
on	1
by	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
her	1
love,	1
rather	1
than	1
by	1
his;	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
wondered	1
why,	1
without	1
violently	1
caring	1
for	1
her,	1
he	1
chose	1
to	1
elope	1
with	1
her	1
at	1
all,	1
had	1
she	1
not	1
felt	1
certain	1
that	1
his	1
flight	1
was	1
rendered	1
necessary	1
by	1
distress	1
of	1
circumstances;	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
were	1
the	1
case,	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
to	1
resist	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
having	1
a	1
companion.	1
Lydia	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
fond	1
of	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
her	1
dear	1
Wickham	1
on	1
every	1
occasion;	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
in	1
competition	1
with	1
him.	1
He	1
did	1
every	1
thing	1
best	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
sure	1
he	1
would	1
kill	1
more	1
birds	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
September,	1
than	1
any	1
body	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
country.	1
One	1
morning,	1
soon	1
after	1
their	1
arrival,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
her	1
two	1
elder	1
sisters,	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
Elizabeth:	1
"Lizzy,	1
I	1
never	1
gave	1
_you_	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
my	1
wedding,	1
I	1
believe.	1
You	1
were	1
not	1
by,	1
when	1
I	1
told	1
mamma	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
all	1
about	1
it.	1
Are	1
not	1
you	1
curious	1
to	1
hear	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
managed?"	1
"No	1
really,"	1
replied	1
Elizabeth;	1
"I	1
think	1
there	1
cannot	1
be	1
too	1
little	1
said	1
on	1
the	1
subject."	1
"La!	1
You	1
are	1
so	1
strange!	1
But	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
it	1
went	1
off.	1
We	1
were	1
married,	1
you	1
know,	1
at	1
St.	1
Clement's,	1
because	1
Wickham's	1
lodgings	1
were	1
in	1
that	1
parish.	1
And	1
it	1
was	1
settled	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
all	1
be	1
there	1
by	1
eleven	1
o'clock.	1
My	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
and	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
together;	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
to	1
meet	1
us	1
at	1
the	1
church.	1
Well,	1
Monday	1
morning	1
came,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
fuss!	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
afraid,	1
you	1
know,	1
that	1
something	1
would	1
happen	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
off,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
gone	1
quite	1
distracted.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
my	1
aunt,	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
was	1
dressing,	1
preaching	1
and	1
talking	1
away	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
reading	1
a	1
sermon.	1
However,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
above	1
one	1
word	1
in	1
ten,	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
thinking,	1
you	1
may	1
suppose,	1
of	1
my	1
dear	1
Wickham.	1
I	1
longed	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
married	1
in	1
his	1
blue	1
coat."	1
"Well,	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
breakfasted	1
at	1
ten	1
as	1
usual;	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
never	1
be	1
over;	1
for,	1
by	1
the	1
bye,	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
understand,	1
that	1
my	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
were	1
horrid	1
unpleasant	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
them.	1
If	1
you'll	1
believe	1
me,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
once	1
put	1
my	1
foot	1
out	1
of	1
doors,	1
though	1
I	1
was	1
there	1
a	1
fortnight.	1
Not	1
one	1
party,	1
or	1
scheme,	1
or	1
anything.	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
London	1
was	1
rather	1
thin,	1
but,	1
however,	1
the	1
Little	1
Theatre	1
was	1
open.	1
Well,	1
and	1
so	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
carriage	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
door,	1
my	1
uncle	1
was	1
called	1
away	1
upon	1
business	1
to	1
that	1
horrid	1
man	1
Mr.	1
Stone.	1
And	1
then,	1
you	1
know,	1
when	1
once	1
they	1
get	1
together,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
end	1
of	1
it.	1
Well,	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
frightened	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
for	1
my	1
uncle	1
was	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
away;	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
beyond	1
the	1
hour,	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
married	1
all	1
day.	1
But,	1
luckily,	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
again	1
in	1
ten	1
minutes'	1
time,	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
all	1
set	1
out.	1
However,	1
I	1
recollected	1
afterwards	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
prevented	1
going,	1
the	1
wedding	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
put	1
off,	1
for	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
might	1
have	1
done	1
as	1
well."	1
"Mr.	1
Darcy!"	1
repeated	1
Elizabeth,	1
in	1
utter	1
amazement.	1
"Oh,	1
yes!--he	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
there	1
with	1
Wickham,	1
you	1
know.	1
But	1
gracious	1
me!	1
I	1
quite	1
forgot!	1
I	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
it.	1
I	1
promised	1
them	1
so	1
faithfully!	1
What	1
will	1
Wickham	1
say?	1
It	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
secret!"	1
"If	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
secret,"	1
said	1
Jane,	1
"say	1
not	1
another	1
word	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
You	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
my	1
seeking	1
no	1
further."	1
"Oh!	1
certainly,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
though	1
burning	1
with	1
curiosity;	1
"we	1
will	1
ask	1
you	1
no	1
questions."	1
"Thank	1
you,"	1
said	1
Lydia,	1
"for	1
if	1
you	1
did,	1
I	1
should	1
certainly	1
tell	1
you	1
all,	1
and	1
then	1
Wickham	1
would	1
be	1
angry."	1
On	1
such	1
encouragement	1
to	1
ask,	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
power,	1
by	1
running	1
away.	1
But	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
ignorance	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
point	1
was	1
impossible;	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
not	1
to	1
try	1
for	1
information.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
her	1
sister's	1
wedding.	1
It	1
was	1
exactly	1
a	1
scene,	1
and	1
exactly	1
among	1
people,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
apparently	1
least	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
least	1
temptation	1
to	1
go.	1
Conjectures	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
it,	1
rapid	1
and	1
wild,	1
hurried	1
into	1
her	1
brain;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
none.	1
Those	1
that	1
best	1
pleased	1
her,	1
as	1
placing	1
his	1
conduct	1
in	1
the	1
noblest	1
light,	1
seemed	1
most	1
improbable.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
bear	1
such	1
suspense;	1
and	1
hastily	1
seizing	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper,	1
wrote	1
a	1
short	1
letter	1
to	1
her	1
aunt,	1
to	1
request	1
an	1
explanation	1
of	1
what	1
Lydia	1
had	1
dropt,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
compatible	1
with	1
the	1
secrecy	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
intended.	1
"You	1
may	1
readily	1
comprehend,"	1
she	1
added,	1
"what	1
my	1
curiosity	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
a	1
person	1
unconnected	1
with	1
any	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
(comparatively	1
speaking)	1
a	1
stranger	1
to	1
our	1
family,	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
amongst	1
you	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time.	1
Pray	1
write	1
instantly,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
understand	1
it--unless	1
it	1
is,	1
for	1
very	1
cogent	1
reasons,	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
the	1
secrecy	1
which	1
Lydia	1
seems	1
to	1
think	1
necessary;	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
must	1
endeavour	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
ignorance."	1
"Not	1
that	1
I	1
_shall_,	1
though,"	1
she	1
added	1
to	1
herself,	1
as	1
she	1
finished	1
the	1
letter;	1
"and	1
my	1
dear	1
aunt,	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
in	1
an	1
honourable	1
manner,	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
be	1
reduced	1
to	1
tricks	1
and	1
stratagems	1
to	1
find	1
it	1
out."	1
Jane's	1
delicate	1
sense	1
of	1
honour	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
her	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
privately	1
of	1
what	1
Lydia	1
had	1
let	1
fall;	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
it;--till	1
it	1
appeared	1
whether	1
her	1
inquiries	1
would	1
receive	1
any	1
satisfaction,	1
she	1
had	1
rather	1
be	1
without	1
a	1
confidante.	1
Chapter	1
52	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
receiving	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
her	1
letter	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
possibly	1
could.	1
She	1
was	1
no	1
sooner	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
it	1
than,	1
hurrying	1
into	1
the	1
little	1
copse,	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
least	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
interrupted,	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
benches	1
and	1
prepared	1
to	1
be	1
happy;	1
for	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
convinced	1
her	1
that	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
contain	1
a	1
denial.	1
"Gracechurch	1
street,	1
Sept.	1
6.	1
"MY	1
DEAR	1
NIECE,	1
"I	1
have	1
just	1
received	1
your	1
letter,	1
and	1
shall	1
devote	1
this	1
whole	1
morning	1
to	1
answering	1
it,	1
as	1
I	1
foresee	1
that	1
a	1
_little_	1
writing	1
will	1
not	1
comprise	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
you.	1
I	1
must	1
confess	1
myself	1
surprised	1
by	1
your	1
application;	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
it	1
from	1
_you_.	1
Don't	1
think	1
me	1
angry,	1
however,	1
for	1
I	1
only	1
mean	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
imagined	1
such	1
inquiries	1
to	1
be	1
necessary	1
on	1
_your_	1
side.	1
If	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
choose	1
to	1
understand	1
me,	1
forgive	1
my	1
impertinence.	1
Your	1
uncle	1
is	1
as	1
much	1
surprised	1
as	1
I	1
am--and	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
belief	1
of	1
your	1
being	1
a	1
party	1
concerned	1
would	1
have	1
allowed	1
him	1
to	1
act	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
done.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
really	1
innocent	1
and	1
ignorant,	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
more	1
explicit.	1
"On	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
coming	1
home	1
from	1
Longbourn,	1
your	1
uncle	1
had	1
a	1
most	1
unexpected	1
visitor.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
called,	1
and	1
was	1
shut	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
several	1
hours.	1
It	1
was	1
all	1
over	1
before	1
I	1
arrived;	1
so	1
my	1
curiosity	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
dreadfully	1
racked	1
as	1
_yours_	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been.	1
He	1
came	1
to	1
tell	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
out	1
where	1
your	1
sister	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
were,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
them	1
both;	1
Wickham	1
repeatedly,	1
Lydia	1
once.	1
From	1
what	1
I	1
can	1
collect,	1
he	1
left	1
Derbyshire	1
only	1
one	1
day	1
after	1
ourselves,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
town	1
with	1
the	1
resolution	1
of	1
hunting	1
for	1
them.	1
The	1
motive	1
professed	1
was	1
his	1
conviction	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
owing	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1
Wickham's	1
worthlessness	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
well	1
known	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
impossible	1
for	1
any	1
young	1
woman	1
of	1
character	1
to	1
love	1
or	1
confide	1
in	1
him.	1
He	1
generously	1
imputed	1
the	1
whole	1
to	1
his	1
mistaken	1
pride,	1
and	1
confessed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
before	1
thought	1
it	1
beneath	1
him	1
to	1
lay	1
his	1
private	1
actions	1
open	1
to	1
the	1
world.	1
His	1
character	1
was	1
to	1
speak	1
for	1
itself.	1
He	1
called	1
it,	1
therefore,	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
step	1
forward,	1
and	1
endeavour	1
to	1
remedy	1
an	1
evil	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
on	1
by	1
himself.	1
If	1
he	1
_had	1
another_	1
motive,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
it	1
would	1
never	1
disgrace	1
him.	1
He	1
had	1
been	1
some	1
days	1
in	1
town,	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
discover	1
them;	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
direct	1
his	1
search,	1
which	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
_we_	1
had;	1
and	1
the	1
consciousness	1
of	1
this	1
was	1
another	1
reason	1
for	1
his	1
resolving	1
to	1
follow	1
us.	1
"There	1
is	1
a	1
lady,	1
it	1
seems,	1
a	1
Mrs.	1
Younge,	1
who	1
was	1
some	1
time	1
ago	1
governess	1
to	1
Miss	1
Darcy,	1
and	1
was	1
dismissed	1
from	1
her	1
charge	1
on	1
some	1
cause	1
of	1
disapprobation,	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
what.	1
She	1
then	1
took	1
a	1
large	1
house	1
in	1
Edward-street,	1
and	1
has	1
since	1
maintained	1
herself	1
by	1
letting	1
lodgings.	1
This	1
Mrs.	1
Younge	1
was,	1
he	1
knew,	1
intimately	1
acquainted	1
with	1
Wickham;	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
intelligence	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
to	1
town.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
days	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
from	1
her	1
what	1
he	1
wanted.	1
She	1
would	1
not	1
betray	1
her	1
trust,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
without	1
bribery	1
and	1
corruption,	1
for	1
she	1
really	1
did	1
know	1
where	1
her	1
friend	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
found.	1
Wickham	1
indeed	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
her	1
on	1
their	1
first	1
arrival	1
in	1
London,	1
and	1
had	1
she	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
receive	1
them	1
into	1
her	1
house,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
up	1
their	1
abode	1
with	1
her.	1
At	1
length,	1
however,	1
our	1
kind	1
friend	1
procured	1
the	1
wished-for	1
direction.	1
They	1
were	1
in	1
----	1
street.	1
He	1
saw	1
Wickham,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
insisted	1
on	1
seeing	1
Lydia.	1
His	1
first	1
object	1
with	1
her,	1
he	1
acknowledged,	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
persuade	1
her	1
to	1
quit	1
her	1
present	1
disgraceful	1
situation,	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
her	1
friends	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
be	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
receive	1
her,	1
offering	1
his	1
assistance,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
go.	1
But	1
he	1
found	1
Lydia	1
absolutely	1
resolved	1
on	1
remaining	1
where	1
she	1
was.	1
She	1
cared	1
for	1
none	1
of	1
her	1
friends;	1
she	1
wanted	1
no	1
help	1
of	1
his;	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
of	1
leaving	1
Wickham.	1
She	1
was	1
sure	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
married	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
other,	1
and	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
much	1
signify	1
when.	1
Since	1
such	1
were	1
her	1
feelings,	1
it	1
only	1
remained,	1
he	1
thought,	1
to	1
secure	1
and	1
expedite	1
a	1
marriage,	1
which,	1
in	1
his	1
very	1
first	1
conversation	1
with	1
Wickham,	1
he	1
easily	1
learnt	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
_his_	1
design.	1
He	1
confessed	1
himself	1
obliged	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
regiment,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
some	1
debts	1
of	1
honour,	1
which	1
were	1
very	1
pressing;	1
and	1
scrupled	1
not	1
to	1
lay	1
all	1
the	1
ill-consequences	1
of	1
Lydia's	1
flight	1
on	1
her	1
own	1
folly	1
alone.	1
He	1
meant	1
to	1
resign	1
his	1
commission	1
immediately;	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
future	1
situation,	1
he	1
could	1
conjecture	1
very	1
little	1
about	1
it.	1
He	1
must	1
go	1
somewhere,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
where,	1
and	1
he	1
knew	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
live	1
on.	1
"Mr.	1
Darcy	1
asked	1
him	1
why	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
married	1
your	1
sister	1
at	1
once.	1
Though	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
not	1
imagined	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
rich,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
situation	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
benefited	1
by	1
marriage.	1
But	1
he	1
found,	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
this	1
question,	1
that	1
Wickham	1
still	1
cherished	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
more	1
effectually	1
making	1
his	1
fortune	1
by	1
marriage	1
in	1
some	1
other	1
country.	1
Under	1
such	1
circumstances,	1
however,	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
proof	1
against	1
the	1
temptation	1
of	1
immediate	1
relief.	1
"They	1
met	1
several	1
times,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
discussed.	1
Wickham	1
of	1
course	1
wanted	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
get;	1
but	1
at	1
length	1
was	1
reduced	1
to	1
be	1
reasonable.	1
"Every	1
thing	1
being	1
settled	1
between	1
_them_,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
next	1
step	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
uncle	1
acquainted	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
first	1
called	1
in	1
Gracechurch	1
street	1
the	1
evening	1
before	1
I	1
came	1
home.	1
But	1
Mr.	1
Gardiner	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
seen,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
found,	1
on	1
further	1
inquiry,	1
that	1
your	1
father	1
was	1
still	1
with	1
him,	1
but	1
would	1
quit	1
town	1
the	1
next	1
morning.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
judge	1
your	1
father	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
person	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
so	1
properly	1
consult	1
as	1
your	1
uncle,	1
and	1
therefore	1
readily	1
postponed	1
seeing	1
him	1
till	1
after	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
the	1
former.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
his	1
name,	1
and	1
till	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
known	1
that	1
a	1
gentleman	1
had	1
called	1
on	1
business.	1
"On	1
Saturday	1
he	1
came	1
again.	1
Your	1
father	1
was	1
gone,	1
your	1
uncle	1
at	1
home,	1
and,	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
before,	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
talk	1
together.	1
"They	1
met	1
again	1
on	1
Sunday,	1
and	1
then	1
_I_	1
saw	1
him	1
too.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
all	1
settled	1
before	1
Monday:	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
the	1
express	1
was	1
sent	1
off	1
to	1
Longbourn.	1
But	1
our	1
visitor	1
was	1
very	1
obstinate.	1
I	1
fancy,	1
Lizzy,	1
that	1
obstinacy	1
is	1
the	1
real	1
defect	1
of	1
his	1
character,	1
after	1
all.	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
accused	1
of	1
many	1
faults	1
at	1
different	1
times,	1
but	1
_this_	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
one.	1
Nothing	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
himself;	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
(and	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
speak	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
thanked,	1
therefore	1
say	1
nothing	1
about	1
it),	1
your	1
uncle	1
would	1
most	1
readily	1
have	1
settled	1
the	1
whole.	1
"They	1
battled	1
it	1
together	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
which	1
was	1
more	1
than	1
either	1
the	1
gentleman	1
or	1
lady	1
concerned	1
in	1
it	1
deserved.	1
But	1
at	1
last	1
your	1
uncle	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
yield,	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
allowed	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
his	1
niece,	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
only	1
having	1
the	1
probable	1
credit	1
of	1
it,	1
which	1
went	1
sorely	1
against	1
the	1
grain;	1
and	1
I	1
really	1
believe	1
your	1
letter	1
this	1
morning	1
gave	1
him	1
great	1
pleasure,	1
because	1
it	1
required	1
an	1
explanation	1
that	1
would	1
rob	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
borrowed	1
feathers,	1
and	1
give	1
the	1
praise	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
due.	1
But,	1
Lizzy,	1
this	1
must	1
go	1
no	1
farther	1
than	1
yourself,	1
or	1
Jane	1
at	1
most.	1
"You	1
know	1
pretty	1
well,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
for	1
the	1
young	1
people.	1
His	1
debts	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
paid,	1
amounting,	1
I	1
believe,	1
to	1
considerably	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
thousand	1
pounds,	1
another	1
thousand	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
settled	1
upon	1
_her_,	1
and	1
his	1
commission	1
purchased.	1
The	1
reason	1
why	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
him	1
alone,	1
was	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
above.	1
It	1
was	1
owing	1
to	1
him,	1
to	1
his	1
reserve	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
proper	1
consideration,	1
that	1
Wickham's	1
character	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
misunderstood,	1
and	1
consequently	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
received	1
and	1
noticed	1
as	1
he	1
was.	1
Perhaps	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
truth	1
in	1
_this_;	1
though	1
I	1
doubt	1
whether	1
_his_	1
reserve,	1
or	1
_anybody's_	1
reserve,	1
can	1
be	1
answerable	1
for	1
the	1
event.	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
fine	1
talking,	1
my	1
dear	1
Lizzy,	1
you	1
may	1
rest	1
perfectly	1
assured	1
that	1
your	1
uncle	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
yielded,	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
given	1
him	1
credit	1
for	1
_another	1
interest_	1
in	1
the	1
affair.	1
"When	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
resolved	1
on,	1
he	1
returned	1
again	1
to	1
his	1
friends,	1
who	1
were	1
still	1
staying	1
at	1
Pemberley;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
agreed	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
London	1
once	1
more	1
when	1
the	1
wedding	1
took	1
place,	1
and	1
all	1
money	1
matters	1
were	1
then	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
last	1
finish.	1
"I	1
believe	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
told	1
you	1
every	1
thing.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
relation	1
which	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
is	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
great	1
surprise;	1
I	1
hope	1
at	1
least	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
afford	1
you	1
any	1
displeasure.	1
Lydia	1
came	1
to	1
us;	1
and	1
Wickham	1
had	1
constant	1
admission	1
to	1
the	1
house.	1
_He_	1
was	1
exactly	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been,	1
when	1
I	1
knew	1
him	1
in	1
Hertfordshire;	1
but	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
little	1
I	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
her	1
behaviour	1
while	1
she	1
staid	1
with	1
us,	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
perceived,	1
by	1
Jane's	1
letter	1
last	1
Wednesday,	1
that	1
her	1
conduct	1
on	1
coming	1
home	1
was	1
exactly	1
of	1
a	1
piece	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
therefore	1
what	1
I	1
now	1
tell	1
you	1
can	1
give	1
you	1
no	1
fresh	1
pain.	1
I	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
repeatedly	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
serious	1
manner,	1
representing	1
to	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
wickedness	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
done,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
unhappiness	1
she	1
had	1
brought	1
on	1
her	1
family.	1
If	1
she	1
heard	1
me,	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
good	1
luck,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
listen.	1
I	1
was	1
sometimes	1
quite	1
provoked,	1
but	1
then	1
I	1
recollected	1
my	1
dear	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
Jane,	1
and	1
for	1
their	1
sakes	1
had	1
patience	1
with	1
her.	1
"Mr.	1
Darcy	1
was	1
punctual	1
in	1
his	1
return,	1
and	1
as	1
Lydia	1
informed	1
you,	1
attended	1
the	1
wedding.	1
He	1
dined	1
with	1
us	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
and	1
was	1
to	1
leave	1
town	1
again	1
on	1
Wednesday	1
or	1
Thursday.	1
Will	1
you	1
be	1
very	1
angry	1
with	1
me,	1
my	1
dear	1
Lizzy,	1
if	1
I	1
take	1
this	1
opportunity	1
of	1
saying	1
(what	1
I	1
was	1
never	1
bold	1
enough	1
to	1
say	1
before)	1
how	1
much	1
I	1
like	1
him.	1
His	1
behaviour	1
to	1
us	1
has,	1
in	1
every	1
respect,	1
been	1
as	1
pleasing	1
as	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
Derbyshire.	1
His	1
understanding	1
and	1
opinions	1
all	1
please	1
me;	1
he	1
wants	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
liveliness,	1
and	1
_that_,	1
if	1
he	1
marry	1
_prudently_,	1
his	1
wife	1
may	1
teach	1
him.	1
I	1
thought	1
him	1
very	1
sly;--he	1
hardly	1
ever	1
mentioned	1
your	1
name.	1
But	1
slyness	1
seems	1
the	1
fashion.	1
"Pray	1
forgive	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
presuming,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
do	1
not	1
punish	1
me	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
exclude	1
me	1
from	1
P.	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
quite	1
happy	1
till	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
park.	1
A	1
low	1
phaeton,	1
with	1
a	1
nice	1
little	1
pair	1
of	1
ponies,	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
very	1
thing.	1
"But	1
I	1
must	1
write	1
no	1
more.	1
The	1
children	1
have	1
been	1
wanting	1
me	1
this	1
half	1
hour.	1
"Yours,	1
very	1
sincerely,	1
"M.	1
GARDINER."	1
The	1
contents	1
of	1
this	1
letter	1
threw	1
Elizabeth	1
into	1
a	1
flutter	1
of	1
spirits,	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
difficult	1
to	1
determine	1
whether	1
pleasure	1
or	1
pain	1
bore	1
the	1
greatest	1
share.	1
The	1
vague	1
and	1
unsettled	1
suspicions	1
which	1
uncertainty	1
had	1
produced	1
of	1
what	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
doing	1
to	1
forward	1
her	1
sister's	1
match,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
feared	1
to	1
encourage	1
as	1
an	1
exertion	1
of	1
goodness	1
too	1
great	1
to	1
be	1
probable,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
dreaded	1
to	1
be	1
just,	1
from	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
obligation,	1
were	1
proved	1
beyond	1
their	1
greatest	1
extent	1
to	1
be	1
true!	1
He	1
had	1
followed	1
them	1
purposely	1
to	1
town,	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
on	1
himself	1
all	1
the	1
trouble	1
and	1
mortification	1
attendant	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
research;	1
in	1
which	1
supplication	1
had	1
been	1
necessary	1
to	1
a	1
woman	1
whom	1
he	1
must	1
abominate	1
and	1
despise,	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
reduced	1
to	1
meet,	1
frequently	1
meet,	1
reason	1
with,	1
persuade,	1
and	1
finally	1
bribe,	1
the	1
man	1
whom	1
he	1
always	1
most	1
wished	1
to	1
avoid,	1
and	1
whose	1
very	1
name	1
it	1
was	1
punishment	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
pronounce.	1
He	1
had	1
done	1
all	1
this	1
for	1
a	1
girl	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
neither	1
regard	1
nor	1
esteem.	1
Her	1
heart	1
did	1
whisper	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
it	1
for	1
her.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
hope	1
shortly	1
checked	1
by	1
other	1
considerations,	1
and	1
she	1
soon	1
felt	1
that	1
even	1
her	1
vanity	1
was	1
insufficient,	1
when	1
required	1
to	1
depend	1
on	1
his	1
affection	1
for	1
her--for	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
refused	1
him--as	1
able	1
to	1
overcome	1
a	1
sentiment	1
so	1
natural	1
as	1
abhorrence	1
against	1
relationship	1
with	1
Wickham.	1
Brother-in-law	1
of	1
Wickham!	1
Every	1
kind	1
of	1
pride	1
must	1
revolt	1
from	1
the	1
connection.	1
He	1
had,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
done	1
much.	1
She	1
was	1
ashamed	1
to	1
think	1
how	1
much.	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
a	1
reason	1
for	1
his	1
interference,	1
which	1
asked	1
no	1
extraordinary	1
stretch	1
of	1
belief.	1
It	1
was	1
reasonable	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
feel	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
wrong;	1
he	1
had	1
liberality,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
exercising	1
it;	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
place	1
herself	1
as	1
his	1
principal	1
inducement,	1
she	1
could,	1
perhaps,	1
believe	1
that	1
remaining	1
partiality	1
for	1
her	1
might	1
assist	1
his	1
endeavours	1
in	1
a	1
cause	1
where	1
her	1
peace	1
of	1
mind	1
must	1
be	1
materially	1
concerned.	1
It	1
was	1
painful,	1
exceedingly	1
painful,	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
under	1
obligations	1
to	1
a	1
person	1
who	1
could	1
never	1
receive	1
a	1
return.	1
They	1
owed	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
Lydia,	1
her	1
character,	1
every	1
thing,	1
to	1
him.	1
Oh!	1
how	1
heartily	1
did	1
she	1
grieve	1
over	1
every	1
ungracious	1
sensation	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
encouraged,	1
every	1
saucy	1
speech	1
she	1
had	1
ever	1
directed	1
towards	1
him.	1
For	1
herself	1
she	1
was	1
humbled;	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
proud	1
of	1
him.	1
Proud	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
cause	1
of	1
compassion	1
and	1
honour,	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
himself.	1
She	1
read	1
over	1
her	1
aunt's	1
commendation	1
of	1
him	1
again	1
and	1
again.	1
It	1
was	1
hardly	1
enough;	1
but	1
it	1
pleased	1
her.	1
She	1
was	1
even	1
sensible	1
of	1
some	1
pleasure,	1
though	1
mixed	1
with	1
regret,	1
on	1
finding	1
how	1
steadfastly	1
both	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
uncle	1
had	1
been	1
persuaded	1
that	1
affection	1
and	1
confidence	1
subsisted	1
between	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
and	1
herself.	1
She	1
was	1
roused	1
from	1
her	1
seat,	1
and	1
her	1
reflections,	1
by	1
some	1
one's	1
approach;	1
and	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
strike	1
into	1
another	1
path,	1
she	1
was	1
overtaken	1
by	1
Wickham.	1
"I	1
am	1
afraid	1
I	1
interrupt	1
your	1
solitary	1
ramble,	1
my	1
dear	1
sister?"	1
said	1
he,	1
as	1
he	1
joined	1
her.	1
"You	1
certainly	1
do,"	1
she	1
replied	1
with	1
a	1
smile;	1
"but	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
follow	1
that	1
the	1
interruption	1
must	1
be	1
unwelcome."	1
"I	1
should	1
be	1
sorry	1
indeed,	1
if	1
it	1
were.	1
We	1
were	1
always	1
good	1
friends;	1
and	1
now	1
we	1
are	1
better."	1
"True.	1
Are	1
the	1
others	1
coming	1
out?"	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
know.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
and	1
Lydia	1
are	1
going	1
in	1
the	1
carriage	1
to	1
Meryton.	1
And	1
so,	1
my	1
dear	1
sister,	1
I	1
find,	1
from	1
our	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt,	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
actually	1
seen	1
Pemberley."	1
She	1
replied	1
in	1
the	1
affirmative.	1
"I	1
almost	1
envy	1
you	1
the	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
yet	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
me,	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
could	1
take	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
Newcastle.	1
And	1
you	1
saw	1
the	1
old	1
housekeeper,	1
I	1
suppose?	1
Poor	1
Reynolds,	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
me.	1
But	1
of	1
course	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
mention	1
my	1
name	1
to	1
you."	1
"Yes,	1
she	1
did."	1
"And	1
what	1
did	1
she	1
say?"	1
"That	1
you	1
were	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
army,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
had--not	1
turned	1
out	1
well.	1
At	1
such	1
a	1
distance	1
as	1
_that_,	1
you	1
know,	1
things	1
are	1
strangely	1
misrepresented."	1
"Certainly,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
biting	1
his	1
lips.	1
Elizabeth	1
hoped	1
she	1
had	1
silenced	1
him;	1
but	1
he	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
said:	1
"I	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
see	1
Darcy	1
in	1
town	1
last	1
month.	1
We	1
passed	1
each	1
other	1
several	1
times.	1
I	1
wonder	1
what	1
he	1
can	1
be	1
doing	1
there."	1
"Perhaps	1
preparing	1
for	1
his	1
marriage	1
with	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth.	1
"It	1
must	1
be	1
something	1
particular,	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
there	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
of	1
year."	1
"Undoubtedly.	1
Did	1
you	1
see	1
him	1
while	1
you	1
were	1
at	1
Lambton?	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
understood	1
from	1
the	1
Gardiners	1
that	1
you	1
had."	1
"Yes;	1
he	1
introduced	1
us	1
to	1
his	1
sister."	1
"And	1
do	1
you	1
like	1
her?"	1
"Very	1
much."	1
"I	1
have	1
heard,	1
indeed,	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
uncommonly	1
improved	1
within	1
this	1
year	1
or	1
two.	1
When	1
I	1
last	1
saw	1
her,	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
promising.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
you	1
liked	1
her.	1
I	1
hope	1
she	1
will	1
turn	1
out	1
well."	1
"I	1
dare	1
say	1
she	1
will;	1
she	1
has	1
got	1
over	1
the	1
most	1
trying	1
age."	1
"Did	1
you	1
go	1
by	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Kympton?"	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
recollect	1
that	1
we	1
did."	1
"I	1
mention	1
it,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
living	1
which	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
had.	1
A	1
most	1
delightful	1
place!--Excellent	1
Parsonage	1
House!	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
suited	1
me	1
in	1
every	1
respect."	1
"How	1
should	1
you	1
have	1
liked	1
making	1
sermons?"	1
"Exceedingly	1
well.	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
considered	1
it	1
as	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
duty,	1
and	1
the	1
exertion	1
would	1
soon	1
have	1
been	1
nothing.	1
One	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
repine;--but,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
for	1
me!	1
The	1
quiet,	1
the	1
retirement	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
life	1
would	1
have	1
answered	1
all	1
my	1
ideas	1
of	1
happiness!	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be.	1
Did	1
you	1
ever	1
hear	1
Darcy	1
mention	1
the	1
circumstance,	1
when	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
Kent?"	1
"I	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
authority,	1
which	1
I	1
thought	1
_as	1
good_,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
left	1
you	1
conditionally	1
only,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
patron."	1
"You	1
have.	1
Yes,	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
in	1
_that_;	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
so	1
from	1
the	1
first,	1
you	1
may	1
remember."	1
"I	1
_did_	1
hear,	1
too,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
time,	1
when	1
sermon-making	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
palatable	1
to	1
you	1
as	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
present;	1
that	1
you	1
actually	1
declared	1
your	1
resolution	1
of	1
never	1
taking	1
orders,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
business	1
had	1
been	1
compromised	1
accordingly."	1
"You	1
did!	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
wholly	1
without	1
foundation.	1
You	1
may	1
remember	1
what	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
on	1
that	1
point,	1
when	1
first	1
we	1
talked	1
of	1
it."	1
They	1
were	1
now	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
walked	1
fast	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
him;	1
and	1
unwilling,	1
for	1
her	1
sister's	1
sake,	1
to	1
provoke	1
him,	1
she	1
only	1
said	1
in	1
reply,	1
with	1
a	1
good-humoured	1
smile:	1
"Come,	1
Mr.	1
Wickham,	1
we	1
are	1
brother	1
and	1
sister,	1
you	1
know.	1
Do	1
not	1
let	1
us	1
quarrel	1
about	1
the	1
past.	1
In	1
future,	1
I	1
hope	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
always	1
of	1
one	1
mind."	1
She	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand;	1
he	1
kissed	1
it	1
with	1
affectionate	1
gallantry,	1
though	1
he	1
hardly	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
look,	1
and	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
house.	1
Chapter	1
53	1
Mr.	1
Wickham	1
was	1
so	1
perfectly	1
satisfied	1
with	1
this	1
conversation	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
again	1
distressed	1
himself,	1
or	1
provoked	1
his	1
dear	1
sister	1
Elizabeth,	1
by	1
introducing	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
enough	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
quiet.	1
The	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
and	1
Lydia's	1
departure	1
soon	1
came,	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
a	1
separation,	1
which,	1
as	1
her	1
husband	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
entered	1
into	1
her	1
scheme	1
of	1
their	1
all	1
going	1
to	1
Newcastle,	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
continue	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
twelvemonth.	1
"Oh!	1
my	1
dear	1
Lydia,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
"when	1
shall	1
we	1
meet	1
again?"	1
"Oh,	1
lord!	1
I	1
don't	1
know.	1
Not	1
these	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
years,	1
perhaps."	1
"Write	1
to	1
me	1
very	1
often,	1
my	1
dear."	1
"As	1
often	1
as	1
I	1
can.	1
But	1
you	1
know	1
married	1
women	1
have	1
never	1
much	1
time	1
for	1
writing.	1
My	1
sisters	1
may	1
write	1
to	1
_me_.	1
They	1
will	1
have	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
do."	1
Mr.	1
Wickham's	1
adieus	1
were	1
much	1
more	1
affectionate	1
than	1
his	1
wife's.	1
He	1
smiled,	1
looked	1
handsome,	1
and	1
said	1
many	1
pretty	1
things.	1
"He	1
is	1
as	1
fine	1
a	1
fellow,"	1
said	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
"as	1
ever	1
I	1
saw.	1
He	1
simpers,	1
and	1
smirks,	1
and	1
makes	1
love	1
to	1
us	1
all.	1
I	1
am	1
prodigiously	1
proud	1
of	1
him.	1
I	1
defy	1
even	1
Sir	1
William	1
Lucas	1
himself	1
to	1
produce	1
a	1
more	1
valuable	1
son-in-law."	1
The	1
loss	1
of	1
her	1
daughter	1
made	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
very	1
dull	1
for	1
several	1
days.	1
"I	1
often	1
think,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"that	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
so	1
bad	1
as	1
parting	1
with	1
one's	1
friends.	1
One	1
seems	1
so	1
forlorn	1
without	1
them."	1
"This	1
is	1
the	1
consequence,	1
you	1
see,	1
Madam,	1
of	1
marrying	1
a	1
daughter,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth.	1
"It	1
must	1
make	1
you	1
better	1
satisfied	1
that	1
your	1
other	1
four	1
are	1
single."	1
"It	1
is	1
no	1
such	1
thing.	1
Lydia	1
does	1
not	1
leave	1
me	1
because	1
she	1
is	1
married,	1
but	1
only	1
because	1
her	1
husband's	1
regiment	1
happens	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
far	1
off.	1
If	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
nearer,	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
gone	1
so	1
soon."	1
But	1
the	1
spiritless	1
condition	1
which	1
this	1
event	1
threw	1
her	1
into	1
was	1
shortly	1
relieved,	1
and	1
her	1
mind	1
opened	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
agitation	1
of	1
hope,	1
by	1
an	1
article	1
of	1
news	1
which	1
then	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
circulation.	1
The	1
housekeeper	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
had	1
received	1
orders	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
her	1
master,	1
who	1
was	1
coming	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two,	1
to	1
shoot	1
there	1
for	1
several	1
weeks.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
quite	1
in	1
the	1
fidgets.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
Jane,	1
and	1
smiled	1
and	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
by	1
turns.	1
"Well,	1
well,	1
and	1
so	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
is	1
coming	1
down,	1
sister,"	1
(for	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips	1
first	1
brought	1
her	1
the	1
news).	1
"Well,	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better.	1
Not	1
that	1
I	1
care	1
about	1
it,	1
though.	1
He	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
us,	1
you	1
know,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
_I_	1
never	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
again.	1
But,	1
however,	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
welcome	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Netherfield,	1
if	1
he	1
likes	1
it.	1
And	1
who	1
knows	1
what	1
_may_	1
happen?	1
But	1
that	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
us.	1
You	1
know,	1
sister,	1
we	1
agreed	1
long	1
ago	1
never	1
to	1
mention	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
it.	1
And	1
so,	1
is	1
it	1
quite	1
certain	1
he	1
is	1
coming?"	1
"You	1
may	1
depend	1
on	1
it,"	1
replied	1
the	1
other,	1
"for	1
Mrs.	1
Nicholls	1
was	1
in	1
Meryton	1
last	1
night;	1
I	1
saw	1
her	1
passing	1
by,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
myself	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
certain	1
true.	1
He	1
comes	1
down	1
on	1
Thursday	1
at	1
the	1
latest,	1
very	1
likely	1
on	1
Wednesday.	1
She	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
butcher's,	1
she	1
told	1
me,	1
on	1
purpose	1
to	1
order	1
in	1
some	1
meat	1
on	1
Wednesday,	1
and	1
she	1
has	1
got	1
three	1
couple	1
of	1
ducks	1
just	1
fit	1
to	1
be	1
killed."	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
without	1
changing	1
colour.	1
It	1
was	1
many	1
months	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
mentioned	1
his	1
name	1
to	1
Elizabeth;	1
but	1
now,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
alone	1
together,	1
she	1
said:	1
"I	1
saw	1
you	1
look	1
at	1
me	1
to-day,	1
Lizzy,	1
when	1
my	1
aunt	1
told	1
us	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
report;	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
appeared	1
distressed.	1
But	1
don't	1
imagine	1
it	1
was	1
from	1
any	1
silly	1
cause.	1
I	1
was	1
only	1
confused	1
for	1
the	1
moment,	1
because	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
I	1
_should_	1
be	1
looked	1
at.	1
I	1
do	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
news	1
does	1
not	1
affect	1
me	1
either	1
with	1
pleasure	1
or	1
pain.	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
of	1
one	1
thing,	1
that	1
he	1
comes	1
alone;	1
because	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
the	1
less	1
of	1
him.	1
Not	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of	1
_myself_,	1
but	1
I	1
dread	1
other	1
people's	1
remarks."	1
Elizabeth	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
it.	1
Had	1
she	1
not	1
seen	1
him	1
in	1
Derbyshire,	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
supposed	1
him	1
capable	1
of	1
coming	1
there	1
with	1
no	1
other	1
view	1
than	1
what	1
was	1
acknowledged;	1
but	1
she	1
still	1
thought	1
him	1
partial	1
to	1
Jane,	1
and	1
she	1
wavered	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
greater	1
probability	1
of	1
his	1
coming	1
there	1
_with_	1
his	1
friend's	1
permission,	1
or	1
being	1
bold	1
enough	1
to	1
come	1
without	1
it.	1
"Yet	1
it	1
is	1
hard,"	1
she	1
sometimes	1
thought,	1
"that	1
this	1
poor	1
man	1
cannot	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
house	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
legally	1
hired,	1
without	1
raising	1
all	1
this	1
speculation!	1
I	1
_will_	1
leave	1
him	1
to	1
himself."	1
In	1
spite	1
of	1
what	1
her	1
sister	1
declared,	1
and	1
really	1
believed	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
feelings	1
in	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
his	1
arrival,	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
easily	1
perceive	1
that	1
her	1
spirits	1
were	1
affected	1
by	1
it.	1
They	1
were	1
more	1
disturbed,	1
more	1
unequal,	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
often	1
seen	1
them.	1
The	1
subject	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
warmly	1
canvassed	1
between	1
their	1
parents,	1
about	1
a	1
twelvemonth	1
ago,	1
was	1
now	1
brought	1
forward	1
again.	1
"As	1
soon	1
as	1
ever	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
comes,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
"you	1
will	1
wait	1
on	1
him	1
of	1
course."	1
"No,	1
no.	1
You	1
forced	1
me	1
into	1
visiting	1
him	1
last	1
year,	1
and	1
promised,	1
if	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
he	1
should	1
marry	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
daughters.	1
But	1
it	1
ended	1
in	1
nothing,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
sent	1
on	1
a	1
fool's	1
errand	1
again."	1
His	1
wife	1
represented	1
to	1
him	1
how	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
such	1
an	1
attention	1
would	1
be	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
gentlemen,	1
on	1
his	1
returning	1
to	1
Netherfield.	1
"'Tis	1
an	1
etiquette	1
I	1
despise,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"If	1
he	1
wants	1
our	1
society,	1
let	1
him	1
seek	1
it.	1
He	1
knows	1
where	1
we	1
live.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
spend	1
my	1
hours	1
in	1
running	1
after	1
my	1
neighbours	1
every	1
time	1
they	1
go	1
away	1
and	1
come	1
back	1
again."	1
"Well,	1
all	1
I	1
know	1
is,	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
abominably	1
rude	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
wait	1
on	1
him.	1
But,	1
however,	1
that	1
shan't	1
prevent	1
my	1
asking	1
him	1
to	1
dine	1
here,	1
I	1
am	1
determined.	1
We	1
must	1
have	1
Mrs.	1
Long	1
and	1
the	1
Gouldings	1
soon.	1
That	1
will	1
make	1
thirteen	1
with	1
ourselves,	1
so	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
just	1
room	1
at	1
table	1
for	1
him."	1
Consoled	1
by	1
this	1
resolution,	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
better	1
able	1
to	1
bear	1
her	1
husband's	1
incivility;	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
mortifying	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
her	1
neighbours	1
might	1
all	1
see	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
it,	1
before	1
_they_	1
did.	1
As	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
arrival	1
drew	1
near,--	1
"I	1
begin	1
to	1
be	1
sorry	1
that	1
he	1
comes	1
at	1
all,"	1
said	1
Jane	1
to	1
her	1
sister.	1
"It	1
would	1
be	1
nothing;	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
him	1
with	1
perfect	1
indifference,	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
bear	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
thus	1
perpetually	1
talked	1
of.	1
My	1
mother	1
means	1
well;	1
but	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
know,	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
know,	1
how	1
much	1
I	1
suffer	1
from	1
what	1
she	1
says.	1
Happy	1
shall	1
I	1
be,	1
when	1
his	1
stay	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
is	1
over!"	1
"I	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
say	1
anything	1
to	1
comfort	1
you,"	1
replied	1
Elizabeth;	1
"but	1
it	1
is	1
wholly	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
power.	1
You	1
must	1
feel	1
it;	1
and	1
the	1
usual	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
preaching	1
patience	1
to	1
a	1
sufferer	1
is	1
denied	1
me,	1
because	1
you	1
have	1
always	1
so	1
much."	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
arrived.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
through	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
servants,	1
contrived	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
earliest	1
tidings	1
of	1
it,	1
that	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
anxiety	1
and	1
fretfulness	1
on	1
her	1
side	1
might	1
be	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
could.	1
She	1
counted	1
the	1
days	1
that	1
must	1
intervene	1
before	1
their	1
invitation	1
could	1
be	1
sent;	1
hopeless	1
of	1
seeing	1
him	1
before.	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
morning	1
after	1
his	1
arrival	1
in	1
Hertfordshire,	1
she	1
saw	1
him,	1
from	1
her	1
dressing-room	1
window,	1
enter	1
the	1
paddock	1
and	1
ride	1
towards	1
the	1
house.	1
Her	1
daughters	1
were	1
eagerly	1
called	1
to	1
partake	1
of	1
her	1
joy.	1
Jane	1
resolutely	1
kept	1
her	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
table;	1
but	1
Elizabeth,	1
to	1
satisfy	1
her	1
mother,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
window--she	1
looked,--she	1
saw	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
by	1
her	1
sister.	1
"There	1
is	1
a	1
gentleman	1
with	1
him,	1
mamma,"	1
said	1
Kitty;	1
"who	1
can	1
it	1
be?"	1
"Some	1
acquaintance	1
or	1
other,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
suppose;	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know."	1
"La!"	1
replied	1
Kitty,	1
"it	1
looks	1
just	1
like	1
that	1
man	1
that	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
him	1
before.	1
Mr.	1
what's-his-name.	1
That	1
tall,	1
proud	1
man."	1
"Good	1
gracious!	1
Mr.	1
Darcy!--and	1
so	1
it	1
does,	1
I	1
vow.	1
Well,	1
any	1
friend	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
will	1
always	1
be	1
welcome	1
here,	1
to	1
be	1
sure;	1
but	1
else	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
hate	1
the	1
very	1
sight	1
of	1
him."	1
Jane	1
looked	1
at	1
Elizabeth	1
with	1
surprise	1
and	1
concern.	1
She	1
knew	1
but	1
little	1
of	1
their	1
meeting	1
in	1
Derbyshire,	1
and	1
therefore	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
awkwardness	1
which	1
must	1
attend	1
her	1
sister,	1
in	1
seeing	1
him	1
almost	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
after	1
receiving	1
his	1
explanatory	1
letter.	1
Both	1
sisters	1
were	1
uncomfortable	1
enough.	1
Each	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
for	1
themselves;	1
and	1
their	1
mother	1
talked	1
on,	1
of	1
her	1
dislike	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
and	1
her	1
resolution	1
to	1
be	1
civil	1
to	1
him	1
only	1
as	1
Mr.	1
Bingley's	1
friend,	1
without	1
being	1
heard	1
by	1
either	1
of	1
them.	1
But	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
sources	1
of	1
uneasiness	1
which	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
suspected	1
by	1
Jane,	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
yet	1
had	1
courage	1
to	1
shew	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner's	1
letter,	1
or	1
to	1
relate	1
her	1
own	1
change	1
of	1
sentiment	1
towards	1
him.	1
To	1
Jane,	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
only	1
a	1
man	1
whose	1
proposals	1
she	1
had	1
refused,	1
and	1
whose	1
merit	1
she	1
had	1
undervalued;	1
but	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
more	1
extensive	1
information,	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
person	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
were	1
indebted	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
benefits,	1
and	1
whom	1
she	1
regarded	1
herself	1
with	1
an	1
interest,	1
if	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
tender,	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
reasonable	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
what	1
Jane	1
felt	1
for	1
Bingley.	1
Her	1
astonishment	1
at	1
his	1
coming--at	1
his	1
coming	1
to	1
Netherfield,	1
to	1
Longbourn,	1
and	1
voluntarily	1
seeking	1
her	1
again,	1
was	1
almost	1
equal	1
to	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
known	1
on	1
first	1
witnessing	1
his	1
altered	1
behaviour	1
in	1
Derbyshire.	1
The	1
colour	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
driven	1
from	1
her	1
face,	1
returned	1
for	1
half	1
a	1
minute	1
with	1
an	1
additional	1
glow,	1
and	1
a	1
smile	1
of	1
delight	1
added	1
lustre	1
to	1
her	1
eyes,	1
as	1
she	1
thought	1
for	1
that	1
space	1
of	1
time	1
that	1
his	1
affection	1
and	1
wishes	1
must	1
still	1
be	1
unshaken.	1
But	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
secure.	1
"Let	1
me	1
first	1
see	1
how	1
he	1
behaves,"	1
said	1
she;	1
"it	1
will	1
then	1
be	1
early	1
enough	1
for	1
expectation."	1
She	1
sat	1
intently	1
at	1
work,	1
striving	1
to	1
be	1
composed,	1
and	1
without	1
daring	1
to	1
lift	1
up	1
her	1
eyes,	1
till	1
anxious	1
curiosity	1
carried	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
her	1
sister	1
as	1
the	1
servant	1
was	1
approaching	1
the	1
door.	1
Jane	1
looked	1
a	1
little	1
paler	1
than	1
usual,	1
but	1
more	1
sedate	1
than	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
expected.	1
On	1
the	1
gentlemen's	1
appearing,	1
her	1
colour	1
increased;	1
yet	1
she	1
received	1
them	1
with	1
tolerable	1
ease,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
propriety	1
of	1
behaviour	1
equally	1
free	1
from	1
any	1
symptom	1
of	1
resentment	1
or	1
any	1
unnecessary	1
complaisance.	1
Elizabeth	1
said	1
as	1
little	1
to	1
either	1
as	1
civility	1
would	1
allow,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
to	1
her	1
work,	1
with	1
an	1
eagerness	1
which	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
often	1
command.	1
She	1
had	1
ventured	1
only	1
one	1
glance	1
at	1
Darcy.	1
He	1
looked	1
serious,	1
as	1
usual;	1
and,	1
she	1
thought,	1
more	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
look	1
in	1
Hertfordshire,	1
than	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
at	1
Pemberley.	1
But,	1
perhaps	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
in	1
her	1
mother's	1
presence	1
be	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
before	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
painful,	1
but	1
not	1
an	1
improbable,	1
conjecture.	1
Bingley,	1
she	1
had	1
likewise	1
seen	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
short	1
period	1
saw	1
him	1
looking	1
both	1
pleased	1
and	1
embarrassed.	1
He	1
was	1
received	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
with	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
civility	1
which	1
made	1
her	1
two	1
daughters	1
ashamed,	1
especially	1
when	1
contrasted	1
with	1
the	1
cold	1
and	1
ceremonious	1
politeness	1
of	1
her	1
curtsey	1
and	1
address	1
to	1
his	1
friend.	1
Elizabeth,	1
particularly,	1
who	1
knew	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
owed	1
to	1
the	1
latter	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
her	1
favourite	1
daughter	1
from	1
irremediable	1
infamy,	1
was	1
hurt	1
and	1
distressed	1
to	1
a	1
most	1
painful	1
degree	1
by	1
a	1
distinction	1
so	1
ill	1
applied.	1
Darcy,	1
after	1
inquiring	1
of	1
her	1
how	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
did,	1
a	1
question	1
which	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
answer	1
without	1
confusion,	1
said	1
scarcely	1
anything.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
seated	1
by	1
her;	1
perhaps	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
his	1
silence;	1
but	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
in	1
Derbyshire.	1
There	1
he	1
had	1
talked	1
to	1
her	1
friends,	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
to	1
herself.	1
But	1
now	1
several	1
minutes	1
elapsed	1
without	1
bringing	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
voice;	1
and	1
when	1
occasionally,	1
unable	1
to	1
resist	1
the	1
impulse	1
of	1
curiosity,	1
she	1
raised	1
her	1
eyes	1
to	1
his	1
face,	1
she	1
as	1
often	1
found	1
him	1
looking	1
at	1
Jane	1
as	1
at	1
herself,	1
and	1
frequently	1
on	1
no	1
object	1
but	1
the	1
ground.	1
More	1
thoughtfulness	1
and	1
less	1
anxiety	1
to	1
please,	1
than	1
when	1
they	1
last	1
met,	1
were	1
plainly	1
expressed.	1
She	1
was	1
disappointed,	1
and	1
angry	1
with	1
herself	1
for	1
being	1
so.	1
"Could	1
I	1
expect	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
otherwise!"	1
said	1
she.	1
"Yet	1
why	1
did	1
he	1
come?"	1
She	1
was	1
in	1
no	1
humour	1
for	1
conversation	1
with	1
anyone	1
but	1
himself;	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
she	1
had	1
hardly	1
courage	1
to	1
speak.	1
She	1
inquired	1
after	1
his	1
sister,	1
but	1
could	1
do	1
no	1
more.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
since	1
you	1
went	1
away,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet.	1
He	1
readily	1
agreed	1
to	1
it.	1
"I	1
began	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
you	1
would	1
never	1
come	1
back	1
again.	1
People	1
_did_	1
say	1
you	1
meant	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
place	1
entirely	1
at	1
Michaelmas;	1
but,	1
however,	1
I	1
hope	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
true.	1
A	1
great	1
many	1
changes	1
have	1
happened	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
since	1
you	1
went	1
away.	1
Miss	1
Lucas	1
is	1
married	1
and	1
settled.	1
And	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
daughters.	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
it;	1
indeed,	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
seen	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
papers.	1
It	1
was	1
in	1
The	1
Times	1
and	1
The	1
Courier,	1
I	1
know;	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
put	1
in	1
as	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be.	1
It	1
was	1
only	1
said,	1
'Lately,	1
George	1
Wickham,	1
Esq.	1
to	1
Miss	1
Lydia	1
Bennet,'	1
without	1
there	1
being	1
a	1
syllable	1
said	1
of	1
her	1
father,	1
or	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
she	1
lived,	1
or	1
anything.	1
It	1
was	1
my	1
brother	1
Gardiner's	1
drawing	1
up	1
too,	1
and	1
I	1
wonder	1
how	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
make	1
such	1
an	1
awkward	1
business	1
of	1
it.	1
Did	1
you	1
see	1
it?"	1
Bingley	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
made	1
his	1
congratulations.	1
Elizabeth	1
dared	1
not	1
lift	1
up	1
her	1
eyes.	1
How	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
looked,	1
therefore,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
tell.	1
"It	1
is	1
a	1
delightful	1
thing,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
daughter	1
well	1
married,"	1
continued	1
her	1
mother,	1
"but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
hard	1
to	1
have	1
her	1
taken	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
from	1
me.	1
They	1
are	1
gone	1
down	1
to	1
Newcastle,	1
a	1
place	1
quite	1
northward,	1
it	1
seems,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
stay	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
long.	1
His	1
regiment	1
is	1
there;	1
for	1
I	1
suppose	1
you	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
leaving	1
the	1
----shire,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
gone	1
into	1
the	1
regulars.	1
Thank	1
Heaven!	1
he	1
has	1
_some_	1
friends,	1
though	1
perhaps	1
not	1
so	1
many	1
as	1
he	1
deserves."	1
Elizabeth,	1
who	1
knew	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
levelled	1
at	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
misery	1
of	1
shame,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
keep	1
her	1
seat.	1
It	1
drew	1
from	1
her,	1
however,	1
the	1
exertion	1
of	1
speaking,	1
which	1
nothing	1
else	1
had	1
so	1
effectually	1
done	1
before;	1
and	1
she	1
asked	1
Bingley	1
whether	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
stay	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
at	1
present.	1
A	1
few	1
weeks,	1
he	1
believed.	1
"When	1
you	1
have	1
killed	1
all	1
your	1
own	1
birds,	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,"	1
said	1
her	1
mother,	1
"I	1
beg	1
you	1
will	1
come	1
here,	1
and	1
shoot	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
you	1
please	1
on	1
Mr.	1
Bennet's	1
manor.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
vastly	1
happy	1
to	1
oblige	1
you,	1
and	1
will	1
save	1
all	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
covies	1
for	1
you."	1
Elizabeth's	1
misery	1
increased,	1
at	1
such	1
unnecessary,	1
such	1
officious	1
attention!	1
Were	1
the	1
same	1
fair	1
prospect	1
to	1
arise	1
at	1
present	1
as	1
had	1
flattered	1
them	1
a	1
year	1
ago,	1
every	1
thing,	1
she	1
was	1
persuaded,	1
would	1
be	1
hastening	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
vexatious	1
conclusion.	1
At	1
that	1
instant,	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
years	1
of	1
happiness	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
Jane	1
or	1
herself	1
amends	1
for	1
moments	1
of	1
such	1
painful	1
confusion.	1
"The	1
first	1
wish	1
of	1
my	1
heart,"	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
herself,	1
"is	1
never	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
either	1
of	1
them.	1
Their	1
society	1
can	1
afford	1
no	1
pleasure	1
that	1
will	1
atone	1
for	1
such	1
wretchedness	1
as	1
this!	1
Let	1
me	1
never	1
see	1
either	1
one	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
again!"	1
Yet	1
the	1
misery,	1
for	1
which	1
years	1
of	1
happiness	1
were	1
to	1
offer	1
no	1
compensation,	1
received	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
material	1
relief,	1
from	1
observing	1
how	1
much	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
sister	1
re-kindled	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
her	1
former	1
lover.	1
When	1
first	1
he	1
came	1
in,	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
her	1
but	1
little;	1
but	1
every	1
five	1
minutes	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
giving	1
her	1
more	1
of	1
his	1
attention.	1
He	1
found	1
her	1
as	1
handsome	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
last	1
year;	1
as	1
good	1
natured,	1
and	1
as	1
unaffected,	1
though	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
chatty.	1
Jane	1
was	1
anxious	1
that	1
no	1
difference	1
should	1
be	1
perceived	1
in	1
her	1
at	1
all,	1
and	1
was	1
really	1
persuaded	1
that	1
she	1
talked	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
ever.	1
But	1
her	1
mind	1
was	1
so	1
busily	1
engaged,	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
always	1
know	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
silent.	1
When	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
rose	1
to	1
go	1
away,	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
mindful	1
of	1
her	1
intended	1
civility,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
invited	1
and	1
engaged	1
to	1
dine	1
at	1
Longbourn	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
time.	1
"You	1
are	1
quite	1
a	1
visit	1
in	1
my	1
debt,	1
Mr.	1
Bingley,"	1
she	1
added,	1
"for	1
when	1
you	1
went	1
to	1
town	1
last	1
winter,	1
you	1
promised	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
family	1
dinner	1
with	1
us,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
you	1
returned.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
forgot,	1
you	1
see;	1
and	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
disappointed	1
that	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
back	1
and	1
keep	1
your	1
engagement."	1
Bingley	1
looked	1
a	1
little	1
silly	1
at	1
this	1
reflection,	1
and	1
said	1
something	1
of	1
his	1
concern	1
at	1
having	1
been	1
prevented	1
by	1
business.	1
They	1
then	1
went	1
away.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
had	1
been	1
strongly	1
inclined	1
to	1
ask	1
them	1
to	1
stay	1
and	1
dine	1
there	1
that	1
day;	1
but,	1
though	1
she	1
always	1
kept	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
table,	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
anything	1
less	1
than	1
two	1
courses	1
could	1
be	1
good	1
enough	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
such	1
anxious	1
designs,	1
or	1
satisfy	1
the	1
appetite	1
and	1
pride	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
ten	1
thousand	1
a	1
year.	1
Chapter	1
54	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
gone,	1
Elizabeth	1
walked	1
out	1
to	1
recover	1
her	1
spirits;	1
or	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
to	1
dwell	1
without	1
interruption	1
on	1
those	1
subjects	1
that	1
must	1
deaden	1
them	1
more.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
behaviour	1
astonished	1
and	1
vexed	1
her.	1
"Why,	1
if	1
he	1
came	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
silent,	1
grave,	1
and	1
indifferent,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"did	1
he	1
come	1
at	1
all?"	1
She	1
could	1
settle	1
it	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
that	1
gave	1
her	1
pleasure.	1
"He	1
could	1
be	1
still	1
amiable,	1
still	1
pleasing,	1
to	1
my	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
town;	1
and	1
why	1
not	1
to	1
me?	1
If	1
he	1
fears	1
me,	1
why	1
come	1
hither?	1
If	1
he	1
no	1
longer	1
cares	1
for	1
me,	1
why	1
silent?	1
Teasing,	1
teasing,	1
man!	1
I	1
will	1
think	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
him."	1
Her	1
resolution	1
was	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
involuntarily	1
kept	1
by	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
her	1
sister,	1
who	1
joined	1
her	1
with	1
a	1
cheerful	1
look,	1
which	1
showed	1
her	1
better	1
satisfied	1
with	1
their	1
visitors,	1
than	1
Elizabeth.	1
"Now,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"that	1
this	1
first	1
meeting	1
is	1
over,	1
I	1
feel	1
perfectly	1
easy.	1
I	1
know	1
my	1
own	1
strength,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
embarrassed	1
again	1
by	1
his	1
coming.	1
I	1
am	1
glad	1
he	1
dines	1
here	1
on	1
Tuesday.	1
It	1
will	1
then	1
be	1
publicly	1
seen	1
that,	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
we	1
meet	1
only	1
as	1
common	1
and	1
indifferent	1
acquaintance."	1
"Yes,	1
very	1
indifferent	1
indeed,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
laughingly.	1
"Oh,	1
Jane,	1
take	1
care."	1
"My	1
dear	1
Lizzy,	1
you	1
cannot	1
think	1
me	1
so	1
weak,	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
danger	1
now?"	1
"I	1
think	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
very	1
great	1
danger	1
of	1
making	1
him	1
as	1
much	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you	1
as	1
ever."	1

They	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
again	1
till	1
Tuesday;	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
in	1
the	1
meanwhile,	1
was	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
happy	1
schemes,	1
which	1
the	1
good	1
humour	1
and	1
common	1
politeness	1
of	1
Bingley,	1
in	1
half	1
an	1
hour's	1
visit,	1
had	1
revived.	1
On	1
Tuesday	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
large	1
party	1
assembled	1
at	1
Longbourn;	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
who	1
were	1
most	1
anxiously	1
expected,	1
to	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
their	1
punctuality	1
as	1
sportsmen,	1
were	1
in	1
very	1
good	1
time.	1
When	1
they	1
repaired	1
to	1
the	1
dining-room,	1
Elizabeth	1
eagerly	1
watched	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
Bingley	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
place,	1
which,	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
former	1
parties,	1
had	1
belonged	1
to	1
him,	1
by	1
her	1
sister.	1
Her	1
prudent	1
mother,	1
occupied	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
ideas,	1
forbore	1
to	1
invite	1
him	1
to	1
sit	1
by	1
herself.	1
On	1
entering	1
the	1
room,	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
hesitate;	1
but	1
Jane	1
happened	1
to	1
look	1
round,	1
and	1
happened	1
to	1
smile:	1
it	1
was	1
decided.	1
He	1
placed	1
himself	1
by	1
her.	1
Elizabeth,	1
with	1
a	1
triumphant	1
sensation,	1
looked	1
towards	1
his	1
friend.	1
He	1
bore	1
it	1
with	1
noble	1
indifference,	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
imagined	1
that	1
Bingley	1
had	1
received	1
his	1
sanction	1
to	1
be	1
happy,	1
had	1
she	1
not	1
seen	1
his	1
eyes	1
likewise	1
turned	1
towards	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
with	1
an	1
expression	1
of	1
half-laughing	1
alarm.	1
His	1
behaviour	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
was	1
such,	1
during	1
dinner	1
time,	1
as	1
showed	1
an	1
admiration	1
of	1
her,	1
which,	1
though	1
more	1
guarded	1
than	1
formerly,	1
persuaded	1
Elizabeth,	1
that	1
if	1
left	1
wholly	1
to	1
himself,	1
Jane's	1
happiness,	1
and	1
his	1
own,	1
would	1
be	1
speedily	1
secured.	1
Though	1
she	1
dared	1
not	1
depend	1
upon	1
the	1
consequence,	1
she	1
yet	1
received	1
pleasure	1
from	1
observing	1
his	1
behaviour.	1
It	1
gave	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
animation	1
that	1
her	1
spirits	1
could	1
boast;	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
no	1
cheerful	1
humour.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
far	1
from	1
her	1
as	1
the	1
table	1
could	1
divide	1
them.	1
He	1
was	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
mother.	1
She	1
knew	1
how	1
little	1
such	1
a	1
situation	1
would	1
give	1
pleasure	1
to	1
either,	1
or	1
make	1
either	1
appear	1
to	1
advantage.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
hear	1
any	1
of	1
their	1
discourse,	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
how	1
seldom	1
they	1
spoke	1
to	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
how	1
formal	1
and	1
cold	1
was	1
their	1
manner	1
whenever	1
they	1
did.	1
Her	1
mother's	1
ungraciousness,	1
made	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
owed	1
him	1
more	1
painful	1
to	1
Elizabeth's	1
mind;	1
and	1
she	1
would,	1
at	1
times,	1
have	1
given	1
anything	1
to	1
be	1
privileged	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
kindness	1
was	1
neither	1
unknown	1
nor	1
unfelt	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
family.	1
She	1
was	1
in	1
hopes	1
that	1
the	1
evening	1
would	1
afford	1
some	1
opportunity	1
of	1
bringing	1
them	1
together;	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
the	1
visit	1
would	1
not	1
pass	1
away	1
without	1
enabling	1
them	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
something	1
more	1
of	1
conversation	1
than	1
the	1
mere	1
ceremonious	1
salutation	1
attending	1
his	1
entrance.	1
Anxious	1
and	1
uneasy,	1
the	1
period	1
which	1
passed	1
in	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
before	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
came,	1
was	1
wearisome	1
and	1
dull	1
to	1
a	1
degree	1
that	1
almost	1
made	1
her	1
uncivil.	1
She	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
their	1
entrance	1
as	1
the	1
point	1
on	1
which	1
all	1
her	1
chance	1
of	1
pleasure	1
for	1
the	1
evening	1
must	1
depend.	1
"If	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
me,	1
_then_,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"I	1
shall	1
give	1
him	1
up	1
for	1
ever."	1
The	1
gentlemen	1
came;	1
and	1
she	1
thought	1
he	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
answered	1
her	1
hopes;	1
but,	1
alas!	1
the	1
ladies	1
had	1
crowded	1
round	1
the	1
table,	1
where	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
was	1
making	1
tea,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
pouring	1
out	1
the	1
coffee,	1
in	1
so	1
close	1
a	1
confederacy	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
vacancy	1
near	1
her	1
which	1
would	1
admit	1
of	1
a	1
chair.	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
gentlemen's	1
approaching,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
girls	1
moved	1
closer	1
to	1
her	1
than	1
ever,	1
and	1
said,	1
in	1
a	1
whisper:	1
"The	1
men	1
shan't	1
come	1
and	1
part	1
us,	1
I	1
am	1
determined.	1
We	1
want	1
none	1
of	1
them;	1
do	1
we?"	1
Darcy	1
had	1
walked	1
away	1
to	1
another	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
She	1
followed	1
him	1
with	1
her	1
eyes,	1
envied	1
everyone	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
spoke,	1
had	1
scarcely	1
patience	1
enough	1
to	1
help	1
anybody	1
to	1
coffee;	1
and	1
then	1
was	1
enraged	1
against	1
herself	1
for	1
being	1
so	1
silly!	1
"A	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
once	1
been	1
refused!	1
How	1
could	1
I	1
ever	1
be	1
foolish	1
enough	1
to	1
expect	1
a	1
renewal	1
of	1
his	1
love?	1
Is	1
there	1
one	1
among	1
the	1
sex,	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
protest	1
against	1
such	1
a	1
weakness	1
as	1
a	1
second	1
proposal	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
woman?	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
indignity	1
so	1
abhorrent	1
to	1
their	1
feelings!"	1
She	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
revived,	1
however,	1
by	1
his	1
bringing	1
back	1
his	1
coffee	1
cup	1
himself;	1
and	1
she	1
seized	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
saying:	1
"Is	1
your	1
sister	1
at	1
Pemberley	1
still?"	1
"Yes,	1
she	1
will	1
remain	1
there	1
till	1
Christmas."	1
"And	1
quite	1
alone?	1
Have	1
all	1
her	1
friends	1
left	1
her?"	1
"Mrs.	1
Annesley	1
is	1
with	1
her.	1
The	1
others	1
have	1
been	1
gone	1
on	1
to	1
Scarborough,	1
these	1
three	1
weeks."	1
She	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
say;	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
converse	1
with	1
her,	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
better	1
success.	1
He	1
stood	1
by	1
her,	1
however,	1
for	1
some	1
minutes,	1
in	1
silence;	1
and,	1
at	1
last,	1
on	1
the	1
young	1
lady's	1
whispering	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
again,	1
he	1
walked	1
away.	1
When	1
the	1
tea-things	1
were	1
removed,	1
and	1
the	1
card-tables	1
placed,	1
the	1
ladies	1
all	1
rose,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
then	1
hoping	1
to	1
be	1
soon	1
joined	1
by	1
him,	1
when	1
all	1
her	1
views	1
were	1
overthrown	1
by	1
seeing	1
him	1
fall	1
a	1
victim	1
to	1
her	1
mother's	1
rapacity	1
for	1
whist	1
players,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
after	1
seated	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
party.	1
She	1
now	1
lost	1
every	1
expectation	1
of	1
pleasure.	1
They	1
were	1
confined	1
for	1
the	1
evening	1
at	1
different	1
tables,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
hope,	1
but	1
that	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
so	1
often	1
turned	1
towards	1
her	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
play	1
as	1
unsuccessfully	1
as	1
herself.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
had	1
designed	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
two	1
Netherfield	1
gentlemen	1
to	1
supper;	1
but	1
their	1
carriage	1
was	1
unluckily	1
ordered	1
before	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
opportunity	1
of	1
detaining	1
them.	1
"Well	1
girls,"	1
said	1
she,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
left	1
to	1
themselves,	1
"What	1
say	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
day?	1
I	1
think	1
every	1
thing	1
has	1
passed	1
off	1
uncommonly	1
well,	1
I	1
assure	1
you.	1
The	1
dinner	1
was	1
as	1
well	1
dressed	1
as	1
any	1
I	1
ever	1
saw.	1
The	1
venison	1
was	1
roasted	1
to	1
a	1
turn--and	1
everybody	1
said	1
they	1
never	1
saw	1
so	1
fat	1
a	1
haunch.	1
The	1
soup	1
was	1
fifty	1
times	1
better	1
than	1
what	1
we	1
had	1
at	1
the	1
Lucases'	1
last	1
week;	1
and	1
even	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
acknowledged,	1
that	1
the	1
partridges	1
were	1
remarkably	1
well	1
done;	1
and	1
I	1
suppose	1
he	1
has	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
French	1
cooks	1
at	1
least.	1
And,	1
my	1
dear	1
Jane,	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
you	1
look	1
in	1
greater	1
beauty.	1
Mrs.	1
Long	1
said	1
so	1
too,	1
for	1
I	1
asked	1
her	1
whether	1
you	1
did	1
not.	1
And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
she	1
said	1
besides?	1
'Ah!	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
her	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
at	1
last.'	1
She	1
did	1
indeed.	1
I	1
do	1
think	1
Mrs.	1
Long	1
is	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
creature	1
as	1
ever	1
lived--and	1
her	1
nieces	1
are	1
very	1
pretty	1
behaved	1
girls,	1
and	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
handsome:	1
I	1
like	1
them	1
prodigiously."	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
in	1
short,	1
was	1
in	1
very	1
great	1
spirits;	1
she	1
had	1
seen	1
enough	1
of	1
Bingley's	1
behaviour	1
to	1
Jane,	1
to	1
be	1
convinced	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
get	1
him	1
at	1
last;	1
and	1
her	1
expectations	1
of	1
advantage	1
to	1
her	1
family,	1
when	1
in	1
a	1
happy	1
humour,	1
were	1
so	1
far	1
beyond	1
reason,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
disappointed	1
at	1
not	1
seeing	1
him	1
there	1
again	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
proposals.	1
"It	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
agreeable	1
day,"	1
said	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
to	1
Elizabeth.	1
"The	1
party	1
seemed	1
so	1
well	1
selected,	1
so	1
suitable	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
other.	1
I	1
hope	1
we	1
may	1
often	1
meet	1
again."	1
Elizabeth	1
smiled.	1
"Lizzy,	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
do	1
so.	1
You	1
must	1
not	1
suspect	1
me.	1
It	1
mortifies	1
me.	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
learnt	1
to	1
enjoy	1
his	1
conversation	1
as	1
an	1
agreeable	1
and	1
sensible	1
young	1
man,	1
without	1
having	1
a	1
wish	1
beyond	1
it.	1
I	1
am	1
perfectly	1
satisfied,	1
from	1
what	1
his	1
manners	1
now	1
are,	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
design	1
of	1
engaging	1
my	1
affection.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
blessed	1
with	1
greater	1
sweetness	1
of	1
address,	1
and	1
a	1
stronger	1
desire	1
of	1
generally	1
pleasing,	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
man."	1
"You	1
are	1
very	1
cruel,"	1
said	1
her	1
sister,	1
"you	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
me	1
smile,	1
and	1
are	1
provoking	1
me	1
to	1
it	1
every	1
moment."	1
"How	1
hard	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
some	1
cases	1
to	1
be	1
believed!"	1
"And	1
how	1
impossible	1
in	1
others!"	1
"But	1
why	1
should	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
persuade	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
feel	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
acknowledge?"	1
"That	1
is	1
a	1
question	1
which	1
I	1
hardly	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
answer.	1
We	1
all	1
love	1
to	1
instruct,	1
though	1
we	1
can	1
teach	1
only	1
what	1
is	1
not	1
worth	1
knowing.	1
Forgive	1
me;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
persist	1
in	1
indifference,	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
me	1
your	1
confidante."	1
Chapter	1
55	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
after	1
this	1
visit,	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
called	1
again,	1
and	1
alone.	1
His	1
friend	1
had	1
left	1
him	1
that	1
morning	1
for	1
London,	1
but	1
was	1
to	1
return	1
home	1
in	1
ten	1
days	1
time.	1
He	1
sat	1
with	1
them	1
above	1
an	1
hour,	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
remarkably	1
good	1
spirits.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
invited	1
him	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
them;	1
but,	1
with	1
many	1
expressions	1
of	1
concern,	1
he	1
confessed	1
himself	1
engaged	1
elsewhere.	1
"Next	1
time	1
you	1
call,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"I	1
hope	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
lucky."	1
He	1
should	1
be	1
particularly	1
happy	1
at	1
any	1
time,	1
etc.	1
etc.;	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
leave,	1
would	1
take	1
an	1
early	1
opportunity	1
of	1
waiting	1
on	1
them.	1
"Can	1
you	1
come	1
to-morrow?"	1
Yes,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
engagement	1
at	1
all	1
for	1
to-morrow;	1
and	1
her	1
invitation	1
was	1
accepted	1
with	1
alacrity.	1
He	1
came,	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
very	1
good	1
time	1
that	1
the	1
ladies	1
were	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
dressed.	1
In	1
ran	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
to	1
her	1
daughter's	1
room,	1
in	1
her	1
dressing	1
gown,	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
hair	1
half	1
finished,	1
crying	1
out:	1
"My	1
dear	1
Jane,	1
make	1
haste	1
and	1
hurry	1
down.	1
He	1
is	1
come--Mr.	1
Bingley	1
is	1
come.	1
He	1
is,	1
indeed.	1
Make	1
haste,	1
make	1
haste.	1
Here,	1
Sarah,	1
come	1
to	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
this	1
moment,	1
and	1
help	1
her	1
on	1
with	1
her	1
gown.	1
Never	1
mind	1
Miss	1
Lizzy's	1
hair."	1
"We	1
will	1
be	1
down	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
we	1
can,"	1
said	1
Jane;	1
"but	1
I	1
dare	1
say	1
Kitty	1
is	1
forwarder	1
than	1
either	1
of	1
us,	1
for	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
stairs	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
ago."	1
"Oh!	1
hang	1
Kitty!	1
what	1
has	1
she	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it?	1
Come	1
be	1
quick,	1
be	1
quick!	1
Where	1
is	1
your	1
sash,	1
my	1
dear?"	1
But	1
when	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
gone,	1
Jane	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
without	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
sisters.	1
The	1
same	1
anxiety	1
to	1
get	1
them	1
by	1
themselves	1
was	1
visible	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
evening.	1
After	1
tea,	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
retired	1
to	1
the	1
library,	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
custom,	1
and	1
Mary	1
went	1
up	1
stairs	1
to	1
her	1
instrument.	1
Two	1
obstacles	1
of	1
the	1
five	1
being	1
thus	1
removed,	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
sat	1
looking	1
and	1
winking	1
at	1
Elizabeth	1
and	1
Catherine	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
time,	1
without	1
making	1
any	1
impression	1
on	1
them.	1
Elizabeth	1
would	1
not	1
observe	1
her;	1
and	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
Kitty	1
did,	1
she	1
very	1
innocently	1
said,	1
"What	1
is	1
the	1
matter	1
mamma?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
keep	1
winking	1
at	1
me	1
for?	1
What	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do?"	1
"Nothing	1
child,	1
nothing.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
wink	1
at	1
you."	1
She	1
then	1
sat	1
still	1
five	1
minutes	1
longer;	1
but	1
unable	1
to	1
waste	1
such	1
a	1
precious	1
occasion,	1
she	1
suddenly	1
got	1
up,	1
and	1
saying	1
to	1
Kitty,	1
"Come	1
here,	1
my	1
love,	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
you,"	1
took	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Jane	1
instantly	1
gave	1
a	1
look	1
at	1
Elizabeth	1
which	1
spoke	1
her	1
distress	1
at	1
such	1
premeditation,	1
and	1
her	1
entreaty	1
that	1
_she_	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
in	1
to	1
it.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
minutes,	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
half-opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
called	1
out:	1
"Lizzy,	1
my	1
dear,	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
you."	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
go.	1
"We	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
leave	1
them	1
by	1
themselves	1
you	1
know;"	1
said	1
her	1
mother,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
hall.	1
"Kitty	1
and	1
I	1
are	1
going	1
up	1
stairs	1
to	1
sit	1
in	1
my	1
dressing-room."	1
Elizabeth	1
made	1
no	1
attempt	1
to	1
reason	1
with	1
her	1
mother,	1
but	1
remained	1
quietly	1
in	1
the	1
hall,	1
till	1
she	1
and	1
Kitty	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
sight,	1
then	1
returned	1
into	1
the	1
drawing-room.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet's	1
schemes	1
for	1
this	1
day	1
were	1
ineffectual.	1
Bingley	1
was	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
charming,	1
except	1
the	1
professed	1
lover	1
of	1
her	1
daughter.	1
His	1
ease	1
and	1
cheerfulness	1
rendered	1
him	1
a	1
most	1
agreeable	1
addition	1
to	1
their	1
evening	1
party;	1
and	1
he	1
bore	1
with	1
the	1
ill-judged	1
officiousness	1
of	1
the	1
mother,	1
and	1
heard	1
all	1
her	1
silly	1
remarks	1
with	1
a	1
forbearance	1
and	1
command	1
of	1
countenance	1
particularly	1
grateful	1
to	1
the	1
daughter.	1
He	1
scarcely	1
needed	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
stay	1
supper;	1
and	1
before	1
he	1
went	1
away,	1
an	1
engagement	1
was	1
formed,	1
chiefly	1
through	1
his	1
own	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet's	1
means,	1
for	1
his	1
coming	1
next	1
morning	1
to	1
shoot	1
with	1
her	1
husband.	1
After	1
this	1
day,	1
Jane	1
said	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
her	1
indifference.	1
Not	1
a	1
word	1
passed	1
between	1
the	1
sisters	1
concerning	1
Bingley;	1
but	1
Elizabeth	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
in	1
the	1
happy	1
belief	1
that	1
all	1
must	1
speedily	1
be	1
concluded,	1
unless	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
returned	1
within	1
the	1
stated	1
time.	1
Seriously,	1
however,	1
she	1
felt	1
tolerably	1
persuaded	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
must	1
have	1
taken	1
place	1
with	1
that	1
gentleman's	1
concurrence.	1
Bingley	1
was	1
punctual	1
to	1
his	1
appointment;	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
spent	1
the	1
morning	1
together,	1
as	1
had	1
been	1
agreed	1
on.	1
The	1
latter	1
was	1
much	1
more	1
agreeable	1
than	1
his	1
companion	1
expected.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
of	1
presumption	1
or	1
folly	1
in	1
Bingley	1
that	1
could	1
provoke	1
his	1
ridicule,	1
or	1
disgust	1
him	1
into	1
silence;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
communicative,	1
and	1
less	1
eccentric,	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
had	1
ever	1
seen	1
him.	1
Bingley	1
of	1
course	1
returned	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
dinner;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet's	1
invention	1
was	1
again	1
at	1
work	1
to	1
get	1
every	1
body	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
her	1
daughter.	1
Elizabeth,	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
write,	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
breakfast	1
room	1
for	1
that	1
purpose	1
soon	1
after	1
tea;	1
for	1
as	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
all	1
going	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
cards,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
wanted	1
to	1
counteract	1
her	1
mother's	1
schemes.	1
But	1
on	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
drawing-room,	1
when	1
her	1
letter	1
was	1
finished,	1
she	1
saw,	1
to	1
her	1
infinite	1
surprise,	1
there	1
was	1
reason	1
to	1
fear	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
had	1
been	1
too	1
ingenious	1
for	1
her.	1
On	1
opening	1
the	1
door,	1
she	1
perceived	1
her	1
sister	1
and	1
Bingley	1
standing	1
together	1
over	1
the	1
hearth,	1
as	1
if	1
engaged	1
in	1
earnest	1
conversation;	1
and	1
had	1
this	1
led	1
to	1
no	1
suspicion,	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
both,	1
as	1
they	1
hastily	1
turned	1
round	1
and	1
moved	1
away	1
from	1
each	1
other,	1
would	1
have	1
told	1
it	1
all.	1
Their	1
situation	1
was	1
awkward	1
enough;	1
but	1
_hers_	1
she	1
thought	1
was	1
still	1
worse.	1
Not	1
a	1
syllable	1
was	1
uttered	1
by	1
either;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
going	1
away	1
again,	1
when	1
Bingley,	1
who	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
other	1
had	1
sat	1
down,	1
suddenly	1
rose,	1
and	1
whispering	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
to	1
her	1
sister,	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room.	1
Jane	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
reserves	1
from	1
Elizabeth,	1
where	1
confidence	1
would	1
give	1
pleasure;	1
and	1
instantly	1
embracing	1
her,	1
acknowledged,	1
with	1
the	1
liveliest	1
emotion,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
happiest	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
"'Tis	1
too	1
much!"	1
she	1
added,	1
"by	1
far	1
too	1
much.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
deserve	1
it.	1
Oh!	1
why	1
is	1
not	1
everybody	1
as	1
happy?"	1
Elizabeth's	1
congratulations	1
were	1
given	1
with	1
a	1
sincerity,	1
a	1
warmth,	1
a	1
delight,	1
which	1
words	1
could	1
but	1
poorly	1
express.	1
Every	1
sentence	1
of	1
kindness	1
was	1
a	1
fresh	1
source	1
of	1
happiness	1
to	1
Jane.	1
But	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
herself	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
her	1
sister,	1
or	1
say	1
half	1
that	1
remained	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
for	1
the	1
present.	1
"I	1
must	1
go	1
instantly	1
to	1
my	1
mother;"	1
she	1
cried.	1
"I	1
would	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
account	1
trifle	1
with	1
her	1
affectionate	1
solicitude;	1
or	1
allow	1
her	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
from	1
anyone	1
but	1
myself.	1
He	1
is	1
gone	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
already.	1
Oh!	1
Lizzy,	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
relate	1
will	1
give	1
such	1
pleasure	1
to	1
all	1
my	1
dear	1
family!	1
how	1
shall	1
I	1
bear	1
so	1
much	1
happiness!"	1
She	1
then	1
hastened	1
away	1
to	1
her	1
mother,	1
who	1
had	1
purposely	1
broken	1
up	1
the	1
card	1
party,	1
and	1
was	1
sitting	1
up	1
stairs	1
with	1
Kitty.	1
Elizabeth,	1
who	1
was	1
left	1
by	1
herself,	1
now	1
smiled	1
at	1
the	1
rapidity	1
and	1
ease	1
with	1
which	1
an	1
affair	1
was	1
finally	1
settled,	1
that	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
so	1
many	1
previous	1
months	1
of	1
suspense	1
and	1
vexation.	1
"And	1
this,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"is	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
friend's	1
anxious	1
circumspection!	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
sister's	1
falsehood	1
and	1
contrivance!	1
the	1
happiest,	1
wisest,	1
most	1
reasonable	1
end!"	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
she	1
was	1
joined	1
by	1
Bingley,	1
whose	1
conference	1
with	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
been	1
short	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
purpose.	1
"Where	1
is	1
your	1
sister?"	1
said	1
he	1
hastily,	1
as	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
door.	1
"With	1
my	1
mother	1
up	1
stairs.	1
She	1
will	1
be	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
moment,	1
I	1
dare	1
say."	1
He	1
then	1
shut	1
the	1
door,	1
and,	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
her,	1
claimed	1
the	1
good	1
wishes	1
and	1
affection	1
of	1
a	1
sister.	1
Elizabeth	1
honestly	1
and	1
heartily	1
expressed	1
her	1
delight	1
in	1
the	1
prospect	1
of	1
their	1
relationship.	1
They	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
great	1
cordiality;	1
and	1
then,	1
till	1
her	1
sister	1
came	1
down,	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
happiness,	1
and	1
of	1
Jane's	1
perfections;	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
a	1
lover,	1
Elizabeth	1
really	1
believed	1
all	1
his	1
expectations	1
of	1
felicity	1
to	1
be	1
rationally	1
founded,	1
because	1
they	1
had	1
for	1
basis	1
the	1
excellent	1
understanding,	1
and	1
super-excellent	1
disposition	1
of	1
Jane,	1
and	1
a	1
general	1
similarity	1
of	1
feeling	1
and	1
taste	1
between	1
her	1
and	1
himself.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
evening	1
of	1
no	1
common	1
delight	1
to	1
them	1
all;	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
Miss	1
Bennet's	1
mind	1
gave	1
a	1
glow	1
of	1
such	1
sweet	1
animation	1
to	1
her	1
face,	1
as	1
made	1
her	1
look	1
handsomer	1
than	1
ever.	1
Kitty	1
simpered	1
and	1
smiled,	1
and	1
hoped	1
her	1
turn	1
was	1
coming	1
soon.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
could	1
not	1
give	1
her	1
consent	1
or	1
speak	1
her	1
approbation	1
in	1
terms	1
warm	1
enough	1
to	1
satisfy	1
her	1
feelings,	1
though	1
she	1
talked	1
to	1
Bingley	1
of	1
nothing	1
else	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour;	1
and	1
when	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
joined	1
them	1
at	1
supper,	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
manner	1
plainly	1
showed	1
how	1
really	1
happy	1
he	1
was.	1
Not	1
a	1
word,	1
however,	1
passed	1
his	1
lips	1
in	1
allusion	1
to	1
it,	1
till	1
their	1
visitor	1
took	1
his	1
leave	1
for	1
the	1
night;	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
gone,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
daughter,	1
and	1
said:	1
"Jane,	1
I	1
congratulate	1
you.	1
You	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
happy	1
woman."	1
Jane	1
went	1
to	1
him	1
instantly,	1
kissed	1
him,	1
and	1
thanked	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
goodness.	1
"You	1
are	1
a	1
good	1
girl;"	1
he	1
replied,	1
"and	1
I	1
have	1
great	1
pleasure	1
in	1
thinking	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
happily	1
settled.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
your	1
doing	1
very	1
well	1
together.	1
Your	1
tempers	1
are	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
unlike.	1
You	1
are	1
each	1
of	1
you	1
so	1
complying,	1
that	1
nothing	1
will	1
ever	1
be	1
resolved	1
on;	1
so	1
easy,	1
that	1
every	1
servant	1
will	1
cheat	1
you;	1
and	1
so	1
generous,	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
always	1
exceed	1
your	1
income."	1
"I	1
hope	1
not	1
so.	1
Imprudence	1
or	1
thoughtlessness	1
in	1
money	1
matters	1
would	1
be	1
unpardonable	1
in	1
me."	1
"Exceed	1
their	1
income!	1
My	1
dear	1
Mr.	1
Bennet,"	1
cried	1
his	1
wife,	1
"what	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
of?	1
Why,	1
he	1
has	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
thousand	1
a	1
year,	1
and	1
very	1
likely	1
more."	1
Then	1
addressing	1
her	1
daughter,	1
"Oh!	1
my	1
dear,	1
dear	1
Jane,	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
happy!	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
I	1
shan't	1
get	1
a	1
wink	1
of	1
sleep	1
all	1
night.	1
I	1
knew	1
how	1
it	1
would	1
be.	1
I	1
always	1
said	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so,	1
at	1
last.	1
I	1
was	1
sure	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
beautiful	1
for	1
nothing!	1
I	1
remember,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
ever	1
I	1
saw	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
first	1
came	1
into	1
Hertfordshire	1
last	1
year,	1
I	1
thought	1
how	1
likely	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
come	1
together.	1
Oh!	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
handsomest	1
young	1
man	1
that	1
ever	1
was	1
seen!"	1
Wickham,	1
Lydia,	1
were	1
all	1
forgotten.	1
Jane	1
was	1
beyond	1
competition	1
her	1
favourite	1
child.	1
At	1
that	1
moment,	1
she	1
cared	1
for	1
no	1
other.	1
Her	1
younger	1
sisters	1
soon	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
interest	1
with	1
her	1
for	1
objects	1
of	1
happiness	1
which	1
she	1
might	1
in	1
future	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
dispense.	1
Mary	1
petitioned	1
for	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
library	1
at	1
Netherfield;	1
and	1
Kitty	1
begged	1
very	1
hard	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
balls	1
there	1
every	1
winter.	1
Bingley,	1
from	1
this	1
time,	1
was	1
of	1
course	1
a	1
daily	1
visitor	1
at	1
Longbourn;	1
coming	1
frequently	1
before	1
breakfast,	1
and	1
always	1
remaining	1
till	1
after	1
supper;	1
unless	1
when	1
some	1
barbarous	1
neighbour,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
enough	1
detested,	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
an	1
invitation	1
to	1
dinner	1
which	1
he	1
thought	1
himself	1
obliged	1
to	1
accept.	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
now	1
but	1
little	1
time	1
for	1
conversation	1
with	1
her	1
sister;	1
for	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
present,	1
Jane	1
had	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
bestow	1
on	1
anyone	1
else;	1
but	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
considerably	1
useful	1
to	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
those	1
hours	1
of	1
separation	1
that	1
must	1
sometimes	1
occur.	1
In	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
Jane,	1
he	1
always	1
attached	1
himself	1
to	1
Elizabeth,	1
for	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
talking	1
of	1
her;	1
and	1
when	1
Bingley	1
was	1
gone,	1
Jane	1
constantly	1
sought	1
the	1
same	1
means	1
of	1
relief.	1
"He	1
has	1
made	1
me	1
so	1
happy,"	1
said	1
she,	1
one	1
evening,	1
"by	1
telling	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
totally	1
ignorant	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
in	1
town	1
last	1
spring!	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
believed	1
it	1
possible."	1
"I	1
suspected	1
as	1
much,"	1
replied	1
Elizabeth.	1
"But	1
how	1
did	1
he	1
account	1
for	1
it?"	1
"It	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
his	1
sister's	1
doing.	1
They	1
were	1
certainly	1
no	1
friends	1
to	1
his	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
me,	1
which	1
I	1
cannot	1
wonder	1
at,	1
since	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
chosen	1
so	1
much	1
more	1
advantageously	1
in	1
many	1
respects.	1
But	1
when	1
they	1
see,	1
as	1
I	1
trust	1
they	1
will,	1
that	1
their	1
brother	1
is	1
happy	1
with	1
me,	1
they	1
will	1
learn	1
to	1
be	1
contented,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
on	1
good	1
terms	1
again;	1
though	1
we	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
what	1
we	1
once	1
were	1
to	1
each	1
other."	1
"That	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
unforgiving	1
speech,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
"that	1
I	1
ever	1
heard	1
you	1
utter.	1
Good	1
girl!	1
It	1
would	1
vex	1
me,	1
indeed,	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
again	1
the	1
dupe	1
of	1
Miss	1
Bingley's	1
pretended	1
regard."	1
"Would	1
you	1
believe	1
it,	1
Lizzy,	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
town	1
last	1
November,	1
he	1
really	1
loved	1
me,	1
and	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
persuasion	1
of	1
_my_	1
being	1
indifferent	1
would	1
have	1
prevented	1
his	1
coming	1
down	1
again!"	1
"He	1
made	1
a	1
little	1
mistake	1
to	1
be	1
sure;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
his	1
modesty."	1
This	1
naturally	1
introduced	1
a	1
panegyric	1
from	1
Jane	1
on	1
his	1
diffidence,	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
value	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
good	1
qualities.	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
betrayed	1
the	1
interference	1
of	1
his	1
friend;	1
for,	1
though	1
Jane	1
had	1
the	1
most	1
generous	1
and	1
forgiving	1
heart	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
she	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
circumstance	1
which	1
must	1
prejudice	1
her	1
against	1
him.	1
"I	1
am	1
certainly	1
the	1
most	1
fortunate	1
creature	1
that	1
ever	1
existed!"	1
cried	1
Jane.	1
"Oh!	1
Lizzy,	1
why	1
am	1
I	1
thus	1
singled	1
from	1
my	1
family,	1
and	1
blessed	1
above	1
them	1
all!	1
If	1
I	1
could	1
but	1
see	1
_you_	1
as	1
happy!	1
If	1
there	1
_were_	1
but	1
such	1
another	1
man	1
for	1
you!"	1
"If	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
forty	1
such	1
men,	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
happy	1
as	1
you.	1
Till	1
I	1
have	1
your	1
disposition,	1
your	1
goodness,	1
I	1
never	1
can	1
have	1
your	1
happiness.	1
No,	1
no,	1
let	1
me	1
shift	1
for	1
myself;	1
and,	1
perhaps,	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
very	1
good	1
luck,	1
I	1
may	1
meet	1
with	1
another	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
in	1
time."	1
The	1
situation	1
of	1
affairs	1
in	1
the	1
Longbourn	1
family	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
long	1
a	1
secret.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
privileged	1
to	1
whisper	1
it	1
to	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips,	1
and	1
she	1
ventured,	1
without	1
any	1
permission,	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
by	1
all	1
her	1
neighbours	1
in	1
Meryton.	1
The	1
Bennets	1
were	1
speedily	1
pronounced	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
luckiest	1
family	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
though	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
weeks	1
before,	1
when	1
Lydia	1
had	1
first	1
run	1
away,	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
generally	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
marked	1
out	1
for	1
misfortune.	1
Chapter	1
56	1
One	1
morning,	1
about	1
a	1
week	1
after	1
Bingley's	1
engagement	1
with	1
Jane	1
had	1
been	1
formed,	1
as	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
females	1
of	1
the	1
family	1
were	1
sitting	1
together	1
in	1
the	1
dining-room,	1
their	1
attention	1
was	1
suddenly	1
drawn	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
by	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
carriage;	1
and	1
they	1
perceived	1
a	1
chaise	1
and	1
four	1
driving	1
up	1
the	1
lawn.	1
It	1
was	1
too	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
for	1
visitors,	1
and	1
besides,	1
the	1
equipage	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
their	1
neighbours.	1
The	1
horses	1
were	1
post;	1
and	1
neither	1
the	1
carriage,	1
nor	1
the	1
livery	1
of	1
the	1
servant	1
who	1
preceded	1
it,	1
were	1
familiar	1
to	1
them.	1
As	1
it	1
was	1
certain,	1
however,	1
that	1
somebody	1
was	1
coming,	1
Bingley	1
instantly	1
prevailed	1
on	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
confinement	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
intrusion,	1
and	1
walk	1
away	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
shrubbery.	1
They	1
both	1
set	1
off,	1
and	1
the	1
conjectures	1
of	1
the	1
remaining	1
three	1
continued,	1
though	1
with	1
little	1
satisfaction,	1
till	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
thrown	1
open	1
and	1
their	1
visitor	1
entered.	1
It	1
was	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh.	1
They	1
were	1
of	1
course	1
all	1
intending	1
to	1
be	1
surprised;	1
but	1
their	1
astonishment	1
was	1
beyond	1
their	1
expectation;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
and	1
Kitty,	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
perfectly	1
unknown	1
to	1
them,	1
even	1
inferior	1
to	1
what	1
Elizabeth	1
felt.	1
She	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
more	1
than	1
usually	1
ungracious,	1
made	1
no	1
other	1
reply	1
to	1
Elizabeth's	1
salutation	1
than	1
a	1
slight	1
inclination	1
of	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word.	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
mentioned	1
her	1
name	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
on	1
her	1
ladyship's	1
entrance,	1
though	1
no	1
request	1
of	1
introduction	1
had	1
been	1
made.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
all	1
amazement,	1
though	1
flattered	1
by	1
having	1
a	1
guest	1
of	1
such	1
high	1
importance,	1
received	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
politeness.	1
After	1
sitting	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
in	1
silence,	1
she	1
said	1
very	1
stiffly	1
to	1
Elizabeth,	1
"I	1
hope	1
you	1
are	1
well,	1
Miss	1
Bennet.	1
That	1
lady,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
is	1
your	1
mother."	1
Elizabeth	1
replied	1
very	1
concisely	1
that	1
she	1
was.	1
"And	1
_that_	1
I	1
suppose	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
sisters."	1
"Yes,	1
madam,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
delighted	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Lady	1
Catherine.	1
"She	1
is	1
my	1
youngest	1
girl	1
but	1
one.	1
My	1
youngest	1
of	1
all	1
is	1
lately	1
married,	1
and	1
my	1
eldest	1
is	1
somewhere	1
about	1
the	1
grounds,	1
walking	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
who,	1
I	1
believe,	1
will	1
soon	1
become	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
family."	1
"You	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
park	1
here,"	1
returned	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
silence.	1
"It	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
comparison	1
of	1
Rosings,	1
my	1
lady,	1
I	1
dare	1
say;	1
but	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
it	1
is	1
much	1
larger	1
than	1
Sir	1
William	1
Lucas's."	1
"This	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
most	1
inconvenient	1
sitting	1
room	1
for	1
the	1
evening,	1
in	1
summer;	1
the	1
windows	1
are	1
full	1
west."	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
sat	1
there	1
after	1
dinner,	1
and	1
then	1
added:	1
"May	1
I	1
take	1
the	1
liberty	1
of	1
asking	1
your	1
ladyship	1
whether	1
you	1
left	1
Mr.	1
and	1
Mrs.	1
Collins	1
well."	1
"Yes,	1
very	1
well.	1
I	1
saw	1
them	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
last."	1
Elizabeth	1
now	1
expected	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
produce	1
a	1
letter	1
for	1
her	1
from	1
Charlotte,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
the	1
only	1
probable	1
motive	1
for	1
her	1
calling.	1
But	1
no	1
letter	1
appeared,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
completely	1
puzzled.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
with	1
great	1
civility,	1
begged	1
her	1
ladyship	1
to	1
take	1
some	1
refreshment;	1
but	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
very	1
resolutely,	1
and	1
not	1
very	1
politely,	1
declined	1
eating	1
anything;	1
and	1
then,	1
rising	1
up,	1
said	1
to	1
Elizabeth,	1
"Miss	1
Bennet,	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
prettyish	1
kind	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
wilderness	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
your	1
lawn.	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
turn	1
in	1
it,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
favour	1
me	1
with	1
your	1
company."	1
"Go,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
cried	1
her	1
mother,	1
"and	1
show	1
her	1
ladyship	1
about	1
the	1
different	1
walks.	1
I	1
think	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
hermitage."	1
Elizabeth	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
running	1
into	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
for	1
her	1
parasol,	1
attended	1
her	1
noble	1
guest	1
downstairs.	1
As	1
they	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
hall,	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
opened	1
the	1
doors	1
into	1
the	1
dining-parlour	1
and	1
drawing-room,	1
and	1
pronouncing	1
them,	1
after	1
a	1
short	1
survey,	1
to	1
be	1
decent	1
looking	1
rooms,	1
walked	1
on.	1
Her	1
carriage	1
remained	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
saw	1
that	1
her	1
waiting-woman	1
was	1
in	1
it.	1
They	1
proceeded	1
in	1
silence	1
along	1
the	1
gravel	1
walk	1
that	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
copse;	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
determined	1
to	1
make	1
no	1
effort	1
for	1
conversation	1
with	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
more	1
than	1
usually	1
insolent	1
and	1
disagreeable.	1
"How	1
could	1
I	1
ever	1
think	1
her	1
like	1
her	1
nephew?"	1
said	1
she,	1
as	1
she	1
looked	1
in	1
her	1
face.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
copse,	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
began	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
manner:--	1
"You	1
can	1
be	1
at	1
no	1
loss,	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
to	1
understand	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
my	1
journey	1
hither.	1
Your	1
own	1
heart,	1
your	1
own	1
conscience,	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
why	1
I	1
come."	1
Elizabeth	1
looked	1
with	1
unaffected	1
astonishment.	1
"Indeed,	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken,	1
Madam.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
at	1
all	1
able	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
seeing	1
you	1
here."	1
"Miss	1
Bennet,"	1
replied	1
her	1
ladyship,	1
in	1
an	1
angry	1
tone,	1
"you	1
ought	1
to	1
know,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
trifled	1
with.	1
But	1
however	1
insincere	1
_you_	1
may	1
choose	1
to	1
be,	1
you	1
shall	1
not	1
find	1
_me_	1
so.	1
My	1
character	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
celebrated	1
for	1
its	1
sincerity	1
and	1
frankness,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
cause	1
of	1
such	1
moment	1
as	1
this,	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
not	1
depart	1
from	1
it.	1
A	1
report	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
alarming	1
nature	1
reached	1
me	1
two	1
days	1
ago.	1
I	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
your	1
sister	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
being	1
most	1
advantageously	1
married,	1
but	1
that	1
you,	1
that	1
Miss	1
Elizabeth	1
Bennet,	1
would,	1
in	1
all	1
likelihood,	1
be	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
united	1
to	1
my	1
nephew,	1
my	1
own	1
nephew,	1
Mr.	1
Darcy.	1
Though	1
I	1
_know_	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
scandalous	1
falsehood,	1
though	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
injure	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
suppose	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
it	1
possible,	1
I	1
instantly	1
resolved	1
on	1
setting	1
off	1
for	1
this	1
place,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
make	1
my	1
sentiments	1
known	1
to	1
you."	1
"If	1
you	1
believed	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
be	1
true,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
colouring	1
with	1
astonishment	1
and	1
disdain,	1
"I	1
wonder	1
you	1
took	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
coming	1
so	1
far.	1
What	1
could	1
your	1
ladyship	1
propose	1
by	1
it?"	1
"At	1
once	1
to	1
insist	1
upon	1
having	1
such	1
a	1
report	1
universally	1
contradicted."	1
"Your	1
coming	1
to	1
Longbourn,	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
family,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth	1
coolly,	1
"will	1
be	1
rather	1
a	1
confirmation	1
of	1
it;	1
if,	1
indeed,	1
such	1
a	1
report	1
is	1
in	1
existence."	1
"If!	1
Do	1
you	1
then	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
ignorant	1
of	1
it?	1
Has	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
industriously	1
circulated	1
by	1
yourselves?	1
Do	1
you	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
report	1
is	1
spread	1
abroad?"	1
"I	1
never	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
was."	1
"And	1
can	1
you	1
likewise	1
declare,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
foundation	1
for	1
it?"	1
"I	1
do	1
not	1
pretend	1
to	1
possess	1
equal	1
frankness	1
with	1
your	1
ladyship.	1
You	1
may	1
ask	1
questions	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
choose	1
to	1
answer."	1
"This	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
borne.	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
I	1
insist	1
on	1
being	1
satisfied.	1
Has	1
he,	1
has	1
my	1
nephew,	1
made	1
you	1
an	1
offer	1
of	1
marriage?"	1
"Your	1
ladyship	1
has	1
declared	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
impossible."	1
"It	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
so;	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so,	1
while	1
he	1
retains	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
his	1
reason.	1
But	1
your	1
arts	1
and	1
allurements	1
may,	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
of	1
infatuation,	1
have	1
made	1
him	1
forget	1
what	1
he	1
owes	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
family.	1
You	1
may	1
have	1
drawn	1
him	1
in."	1
"If	1
I	1
have,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
person	1
to	1
confess	1
it."	1
"Miss	1
Bennet,	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
who	1
I	1
am?	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
accustomed	1
to	1
such	1
language	1
as	1
this.	1
I	1
am	1
almost	1
the	1
nearest	1
relation	1
he	1
has	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
am	1
entitled	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
his	1
dearest	1
concerns."	1
"But	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
entitled	1
to	1
know	1
mine;	1
nor	1
will	1
such	1
behaviour	1
as	1
this,	1
ever	1
induce	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
explicit."	1
"Let	1
me	1
be	1
rightly	1
understood.	1
This	1
match,	1
to	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
presumption	1
to	1
aspire,	1
can	1
never	1
take	1
place.	1
No,	1
never.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
is	1
engaged	1
to	1
my	1
daughter.	1
Now	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
to	1
say?"	1
"Only	1
this;	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
so,	1
you	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
suppose	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
offer	1
to	1
me."	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
hesitated	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
then	1
replied:	1
"The	1
engagement	1
between	1
them	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
peculiar	1
kind.	1
From	1
their	1
infancy,	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
intended	1
for	1
each	1
other.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
favourite	1
wish	1
of	1
_his_	1
mother,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
of	1
hers.	1
While	1
in	1
their	1
cradles,	1
we	1
planned	1
the	1
union:	1
and	1
now,	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
both	1
sisters	1
would	1
be	1
accomplished	1
in	1
their	1
marriage,	1
to	1
be	1
prevented	1
by	1
a	1
young	1
woman	1
of	1
inferior	1
birth,	1
of	1
no	1
importance	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
wholly	1
unallied	1
to	1
the	1
family!	1
Do	1
you	1
pay	1
no	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
his	1
friends?	1
To	1
his	1
tacit	1
engagement	1
with	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh?	1
Are	1
you	1
lost	1
to	1
every	1
feeling	1
of	1
propriety	1
and	1
delicacy?	1
Have	1
you	1
not	1
heard	1
me	1
say	1
that	1
from	1
his	1
earliest	1
hours	1
he	1
was	1
destined	1
for	1
his	1
cousin?"	1
"Yes,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
it	1
before.	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
me?	1
If	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
other	1
objection	1
to	1
my	1
marrying	1
your	1
nephew,	1
I	1
shall	1
certainly	1
not	1
be	1
kept	1
from	1
it	1
by	1
knowing	1
that	1
his	1
mother	1
and	1
aunt	1
wished	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
Miss	1
de	1
Bourgh.	1
You	1
both	1
did	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
could	1
in	1
planning	1
the	1
marriage.	1
Its	1
completion	1
depended	1
on	1
others.	1
If	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
is	1
neither	1
by	1
honour	1
nor	1
inclination	1
confined	1
to	1
his	1
cousin,	1
why	1
is	1
not	1
he	1
to	1
make	1
another	1
choice?	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
that	1
choice,	1
why	1
may	1
not	1
I	1
accept	1
him?"	1
"Because	1
honour,	1
decorum,	1
prudence,	1
nay,	1
interest,	1
forbid	1
it.	1
Yes,	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
interest;	1
for	1
do	1
not	1
expect	1
to	1
be	1
noticed	1
by	1
his	1
family	1
or	1
friends,	1
if	1
you	1
wilfully	1
act	1
against	1
the	1
inclinations	1
of	1
all.	1
You	1
will	1
be	1
censured,	1
slighted,	1
and	1
despised,	1
by	1
everyone	1
connected	1
with	1
him.	1
Your	1
alliance	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
disgrace;	1
your	1
name	1
will	1
never	1
even	1
be	1
mentioned	1
by	1
any	1
of	1
us."	1
"These	1
are	1
heavy	1
misfortunes,"	1
replied	1
Elizabeth.	1
"But	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
must	1
have	1
such	1
extraordinary	1
sources	1
of	1
happiness	1
necessarily	1
attached	1
to	1
her	1
situation,	1
that	1
she	1
could,	1
upon	1
the	1
whole,	1
have	1
no	1
cause	1
to	1
repine."	1
"Obstinate,	1
headstrong	1
girl!	1
I	1
am	1
ashamed	1
of	1
you!	1
Is	1
this	1
your	1
gratitude	1
for	1
my	1
attentions	1
to	1
you	1
last	1
spring?	1
Is	1
nothing	1
due	1
to	1
me	1
on	1
that	1
score?	1
Let	1
us	1
sit	1
down.	1
You	1
are	1
to	1
understand,	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
that	1
I	1
came	1
here	1
with	1
the	1
determined	1
resolution	1
of	1
carrying	1
my	1
purpose;	1
nor	1
will	1
I	1
be	1
dissuaded	1
from	1
it.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
used	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
any	1
person's	1
whims.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
brooking	1
disappointment."	1
"_That_	1
will	1
make	1
your	1
ladyship's	1
situation	1
at	1
present	1
more	1
pitiable;	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
effect	1
on	1
me."	1
"I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
interrupted.	1
Hear	1
me	1
in	1
silence.	1
My	1
daughter	1
and	1
my	1
nephew	1
are	1
formed	1
for	1
each	1
other.	1
They	1
are	1
descended,	1
on	1
the	1
maternal	1
side,	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
noble	1
line;	1
and,	1
on	1
the	1
father's,	1
from	1
respectable,	1
honourable,	1
and	1
ancient--though	1
untitled--families.	1
Their	1
fortune	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
is	1
splendid.	1
They	1
are	1
destined	1
for	1
each	1
other	1
by	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
every	1
member	1
of	1
their	1
respective	1
houses;	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
divide	1
them?	1
The	1
upstart	1
pretensions	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
woman	1
without	1
family,	1
connections,	1
or	1
fortune.	1
Is	1
this	1
to	1
be	1
endured!	1
But	1
it	1
must	1
not,	1
shall	1
not	1
be.	1
If	1
you	1
were	1
sensible	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
good,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
sphere	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
brought	1
up."	1
"In	1
marrying	1
your	1
nephew,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
consider	1
myself	1
as	1
quitting	1
that	1
sphere.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
gentleman;	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
gentleman's	1
daughter;	1
so	1
far	1
we	1
are	1
equal."	1
"True.	1
You	1
_are_	1
a	1
gentleman's	1
daughter.	1
But	1
who	1
was	1
your	1
mother?	1
Who	1
are	1
your	1
uncles	1
and	1
aunts?	1
Do	1
not	1
imagine	1
me	1
ignorant	1
of	1
their	1
condition."	1
"Whatever	1
my	1
connections	1
may	1
be,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
"if	1
your	1
nephew	1
does	1
not	1
object	1
to	1
them,	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
nothing	1
to	1
_you_."	1
"Tell	1
me	1
once	1
for	1
all,	1
are	1
you	1
engaged	1
to	1
him?"	1
Though	1
Elizabeth	1
would	1
not,	1
for	1
the	1
mere	1
purpose	1
of	1
obliging	1
Lady	1
Catherine,	1
have	1
answered	1
this	1
question,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
say,	1
after	1
a	1
moment's	1
deliberation:	1
"I	1
am	1
not."	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
seemed	1
pleased.	1
"And	1
will	1
you	1
promise	1
me,	1
never	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
such	1
an	1
engagement?"	1
"I	1
will	1
make	1
no	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
kind."	1
"Miss	1
Bennet	1
I	1
am	1
shocked	1
and	1
astonished.	1
I	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
more	1
reasonable	1
young	1
woman.	1
But	1
do	1
not	1
deceive	1
yourself	1
into	1
a	1
belief	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
ever	1
recede.	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
go	1
away	1
till	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
me	1
the	1
assurance	1
I	1
require."	1
"And	1
I	1
certainly	1
_never_	1
shall	1
give	1
it.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
intimidated	1
into	1
anything	1
so	1
wholly	1
unreasonable.	1
Your	1
ladyship	1
wants	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
to	1
marry	1
your	1
daughter;	1
but	1
would	1
my	1
giving	1
you	1
the	1
wished-for	1
promise	1
make	1
their	1
marriage	1
at	1
all	1
more	1
probable?	1
Supposing	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
attached	1
to	1
me,	1
would	1
my	1
refusing	1
to	1
accept	1
his	1
hand	1
make	1
him	1
wish	1
to	1
bestow	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
cousin?	1
Allow	1
me	1
to	1
say,	1
Lady	1
Catherine,	1
that	1
the	1
arguments	1
with	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
supported	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
application	1
have	1
been	1
as	1
frivolous	1
as	1
the	1
application	1
was	1
ill-judged.	1
You	1
have	1
widely	1
mistaken	1
my	1
character,	1
if	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
can	1
be	1
worked	1
on	1
by	1
such	1
persuasions	1
as	1
these.	1
How	1
far	1
your	1
nephew	1
might	1
approve	1
of	1
your	1
interference	1
in	1
his	1
affairs,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell;	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
certainly	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
concern	1
yourself	1
in	1
mine.	1
I	1
must	1
beg,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
be	1
importuned	1
no	1
farther	1
on	1
the	1
subject."	1
"Not	1
so	1
hasty,	1
if	1
you	1
please.	1
I	1
have	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
done.	1
To	1
all	1
the	1
objections	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
urged,	1
I	1
have	1
still	1
another	1
to	1
add.	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
stranger	1
to	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
your	1
youngest	1
sister's	1
infamous	1
elopement.	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
all;	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
man's	1
marrying	1
her	1
was	1
a	1
patched-up	1
business,	1
at	1
the	1
expence	1
of	1
your	1
father	1
and	1
uncles.	1
And	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
girl	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
nephew's	1
sister?	1
Is	1
her	1
husband,	1
is	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
late	1
father's	1
steward,	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
brother?	1
Heaven	1
and	1
earth!--of	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
thinking?	1
Are	1
the	1
shades	1
of	1
Pemberley	1
to	1
be	1
thus	1
polluted?"	1
"You	1
can	1
now	1
have	1
nothing	1
further	1
to	1
say,"	1
she	1
resentfully	1
answered.	1
"You	1
have	1
insulted	1
me	1
in	1
every	1
possible	1
method.	1
I	1
must	1
beg	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
house."	1
And	1
she	1
rose	1
as	1
she	1
spoke.	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
rose	1
also,	1
and	1
they	1
turned	1
back.	1
Her	1
ladyship	1
was	1
highly	1
incensed.	1
"You	1
have	1
no	1
regard,	1
then,	1
for	1
the	1
honour	1
and	1
credit	1
of	1
my	1
nephew!	1
Unfeeling,	1
selfish	1
girl!	1
Do	1
you	1
not	1
consider	1
that	1
a	1
connection	1
with	1
you	1
must	1
disgrace	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
everybody?"	1
"Lady	1
Catherine,	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
further	1
to	1
say.	1
You	1
know	1
my	1
sentiments."	1
"You	1
are	1
then	1
resolved	1
to	1
have	1
him?"	1
"I	1
have	1
said	1
no	1
such	1
thing.	1
I	1
am	1
only	1
resolved	1
to	1
act	1
in	1
that	1
manner,	1
which	1
will,	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
opinion,	1
constitute	1
my	1
happiness,	1
without	1
reference	1
to	1
_you_,	1
or	1
to	1
any	1
person	1
so	1
wholly	1
unconnected	1
with	1
me."	1
"It	1
is	1
well.	1
You	1
refuse,	1
then,	1
to	1
oblige	1
me.	1
You	1
refuse	1
to	1
obey	1
the	1
claims	1
of	1
duty,	1
honour,	1
and	1
gratitude.	1
You	1
are	1
determined	1
to	1
ruin	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
friends,	1
and	1
make	1
him	1
the	1
contempt	1
of	1
the	1
world."	1
"Neither	1
duty,	1
nor	1
honour,	1
nor	1
gratitude,"	1
replied	1
Elizabeth,	1
"have	1
any	1
possible	1
claim	1
on	1
me,	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
instance.	1
No	1
principle	1
of	1
either	1
would	1
be	1
violated	1
by	1
my	1
marriage	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Darcy.	1
And	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
resentment	1
of	1
his	1
family,	1
or	1
the	1
indignation	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
if	1
the	1
former	1
_were_	1
excited	1
by	1
his	1
marrying	1
me,	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
me	1
one	1
moment's	1
concern--and	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
general	1
would	1
have	1
too	1
much	1
sense	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
the	1
scorn."	1
"And	1
this	1
is	1
your	1
real	1
opinion!	1
This	1
is	1
your	1
final	1
resolve!	1
Very	1
well.	1
I	1
shall	1
now	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
act.	1
Do	1
not	1
imagine,	1
Miss	1
Bennet,	1
that	1
your	1
ambition	1
will	1
ever	1
be	1
gratified.	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
try	1
you.	1
I	1
hoped	1
to	1
find	1
you	1
reasonable;	1
but,	1
depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
I	1
will	1
carry	1
my	1
point."	1
In	1
this	1
manner	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
talked	1
on,	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
carriage,	1
when,	1
turning	1
hastily	1
round,	1
she	1
added,	1
"I	1
take	1
no	1
leave	1
of	1
you,	1
Miss	1
Bennet.	1
I	1
send	1
no	1
compliments	1
to	1
your	1
mother.	1
You	1
deserve	1
no	1
such	1
attention.	1
I	1
am	1
most	1
seriously	1
displeased."	1
Elizabeth	1
made	1
no	1
answer;	1
and	1
without	1
attempting	1
to	1
persuade	1
her	1
ladyship	1
to	1
return	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
walked	1
quietly	1
into	1
it	1
herself.	1
She	1
heard	1
the	1
carriage	1
drive	1
away	1
as	1
she	1
proceeded	1
up	1
stairs.	1
Her	1
mother	1
impatiently	1
met	1
her	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
dressing-room,	1
to	1
ask	1
why	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
in	1
again	1
and	1
rest	1
herself.	1
"She	1
did	1
not	1
choose	1
it,"	1
said	1
her	1
daughter,	1
"she	1
would	1
go."	1
"She	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
fine-looking	1
woman!	1
and	1
her	1
calling	1
here	1
was	1
prodigiously	1
civil!	1
for	1
she	1
only	1
came,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
to	1
tell	1
us	1
the	1
Collinses	1
were	1
well.	1
She	1
is	1
on	1
her	1
road	1
somewhere,	1
I	1
dare	1
say,	1
and	1
so,	1
passing	1
through	1
Meryton,	1
thought	1
she	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
call	1
on	1
you.	1
I	1
suppose	1
she	1
had	1
nothing	1
particular	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you,	1
Lizzy?"	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
give	1
into	1
a	1
little	1
falsehood	1
here;	1
for	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
their	1
conversation	1
was	1
impossible.	1
Chapter	1
57	1
The	1
discomposure	1
of	1
spirits	1
which	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
visit	1
threw	1
Elizabeth	1
into,	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
easily	1
overcome;	1
nor	1
could	1
she,	1
for	1
many	1
hours,	1
learn	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
less	1
than	1
incessantly.	1
Lady	1
Catherine,	1
it	1
appeared,	1
had	1
actually	1
taken	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
this	1
journey	1
from	1
Rosings,	1
for	1
the	1
sole	1
purpose	1
of	1
breaking	1
off	1
her	1
supposed	1
engagement	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Darcy.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
rational	1
scheme,	1
to	1
be	1
sure!	1
but	1
from	1
what	1
the	1
report	1
of	1
their	1
engagement	1
could	1
originate,	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
imagine;	1
till	1
she	1
recollected	1
that	1
_his_	1
being	1
the	1
intimate	1
friend	1
of	1
Bingley,	1
and	1
_her_	1
being	1
the	1
sister	1
of	1
Jane,	1
was	1
enough,	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
expectation	1
of	1
one	1
wedding	1
made	1
everybody	1
eager	1
for	1
another,	1
to	1
supply	1
the	1
idea.	1
She	1
had	1
not	1
herself	1
forgotten	1
to	1
feel	1
that	1
the	1
marriage	1
of	1
her	1
sister	1
must	1
bring	1
them	1
more	1
frequently	1
together.	1
And	1
her	1
neighbours	1
at	1
Lucas	1
Lodge,	1
therefore	1
(for	1
through	1
their	1
communication	1
with	1
the	1
Collinses,	1
the	1
report,	1
she	1
concluded,	1
had	1
reached	1
Lady	1
Catherine),	1
had	1
only	1
set	1
that	1
down	1
as	1
almost	1
certain	1
and	1
immediate,	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
as	1
possible	1
at	1
some	1
future	1
time.	1
In	1
revolving	1
Lady	1
Catherine's	1
expressions,	1
however,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
feeling	1
some	1
uneasiness	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
possible	1
consequence	1
of	1
her	1
persisting	1
in	1
this	1
interference.	1
From	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
of	1
her	1
resolution	1
to	1
prevent	1
their	1
marriage,	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
meditate	1
an	1
application	1
to	1
her	1
nephew;	1
and	1
how	1
_he_	1
might	1
take	1
a	1
similar	1
representation	1
of	1
the	1
evils	1
attached	1
to	1
a	1
connection	1
with	1
her,	1
she	1
dared	1
not	1
pronounce.	1
She	1
knew	1
not	1
the	1
exact	1
degree	1
of	1
his	1
affection	1
for	1
his	1
aunt,	1
or	1
his	1
dependence	1
on	1
her	1
judgment,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
natural	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
much	1
higher	1
of	1
her	1
ladyship	1
than	1
_she_	1
could	1
do;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
certain	1
that,	1
in	1
enumerating	1
the	1
miseries	1
of	1
a	1
marriage	1
with	1
_one_,	1
whose	1
immediate	1
connections	1
were	1
so	1
unequal	1
to	1
his	1
own,	1
his	1
aunt	1
would	1
address	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
weakest	1
side.	1
With	1
his	1
notions	1
of	1
dignity,	1
he	1
would	1
probably	1
feel	1
that	1
the	1
arguments,	1
which	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
appeared	1
weak	1
and	1
ridiculous,	1
contained	1
much	1
good	1
sense	1
and	1
solid	1
reasoning.	1
If	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
wavering	1
before	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
should	1
do,	1
which	1
had	1
often	1
seemed	1
likely,	1
the	1
advice	1
and	1
entreaty	1
of	1
so	1
near	1
a	1
relation	1
might	1
settle	1
every	1
doubt,	1
and	1
determine	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
happy	1
as	1
dignity	1
unblemished	1
could	1
make	1
him.	1
In	1
that	1
case	1
he	1
would	1
return	1
no	1
more.	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
might	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
way	1
through	1
town;	1
and	1
his	1
engagement	1
to	1
Bingley	1
of	1
coming	1
again	1
to	1
Netherfield	1
must	1
give	1
way.	1
"If,	1
therefore,	1
an	1
excuse	1
for	1
not	1
keeping	1
his	1
promise	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
friend	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
days,"	1
she	1
added,	1
"I	1
shall	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
understand	1
it.	1
I	1
shall	1
then	1
give	1
over	1
every	1
expectation,	1
every	1
wish	1
of	1
his	1
constancy.	1
If	1
he	1
is	1
satisfied	1
with	1
only	1
regretting	1
me,	1
when	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
obtained	1
my	1
affections	1
and	1
hand,	1
I	1
shall	1
soon	1
cease	1
to	1
regret	1
him	1
at	1
all."	1

The	1
surprise	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
on	1
hearing	1
who	1
their	1
visitor	1
had	1
been,	1
was	1
very	1
great;	1
but	1
they	1
obligingly	1
satisfied	1
it,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
of	1
supposition	1
which	1
had	1
appeased	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet's	1
curiosity;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
spared	1
from	1
much	1
teasing	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
The	1
next	1
morning,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
downstairs,	1
she	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
her	1
father,	1
who	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
library	1
with	1
a	1
letter	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
"Lizzy,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"I	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
you;	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
room."	1
She	1
followed	1
him	1
thither;	1
and	1
her	1
curiosity	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
was	1
heightened	1
by	1
the	1
supposition	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
in	1
some	1
manner	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
letter	1
he	1
held.	1
It	1
suddenly	1
struck	1
her	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
from	1
Lady	1
Catherine;	1
and	1
she	1
anticipated	1
with	1
dismay	1
all	1
the	1
consequent	1
explanations.	1
She	1
followed	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
place,	1
and	1
they	1
both	1
sat	1
down.	1
He	1
then	1
said,	1
"I	1
have	1
received	1
a	1
letter	1
this	1
morning	1
that	1
has	1
astonished	1
me	1
exceedingly.	1
As	1
it	1
principally	1
concerns	1
yourself,	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
its	1
contents.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
before,	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
two	1
daughters	1
on	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
matrimony.	1
Let	1
me	1
congratulate	1
you	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
conquest."	1
The	1
colour	1
now	1
rushed	1
into	1
Elizabeth's	1
cheeks	1
in	1
the	1
instantaneous	1
conviction	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
the	1
nephew,	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
aunt;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
undetermined	1
whether	1
most	1
to	1
be	1
pleased	1
that	1
he	1
explained	1
himself	1
at	1
all,	1
or	1
offended	1
that	1
his	1
letter	1
was	1
not	1
rather	1
addressed	1
to	1
herself;	1
when	1
her	1
father	1
continued:	1
"You	1
look	1
conscious.	1
Young	1
ladies	1
have	1
great	1
penetration	1
in	1
such	1
matters	1
as	1
these;	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
may	1
defy	1
even	1
_your_	1
sagacity,	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
your	1
admirer.	1
This	1
letter	1
is	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Collins."	1
"From	1
Mr.	1
Collins!	1
and	1
what	1
can	1
_he_	1
have	1
to	1
say?"	1
"Something	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
course.	1
He	1
begins	1
with	1
congratulations	1
on	1
the	1
approaching	1
nuptials	1
of	1
my	1
eldest	1
daughter,	1
of	1
which,	1
it	1
seems,	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
told	1
by	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
good-natured,	1
gossiping	1
Lucases.	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
sport	1
with	1
your	1
impatience,	1
by	1
reading	1
what	1
he	1
says	1
on	1
that	1
point.	1
What	1
relates	1
to	1
yourself,	1
is	1
as	1
follows:	1
'Having	1
thus	1
offered	1
you	1
the	1
sincere	1
congratulations	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Collins	1
and	1
myself	1
on	1
this	1
happy	1
event,	1
let	1
me	1
now	1
add	1
a	1
short	1
hint	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
another;	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
advertised	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
authority.	1
Your	1
daughter	1
Elizabeth,	1
it	1
is	1
presumed,	1
will	1
not	1
long	1
bear	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Bennet,	1
after	1
her	1
elder	1
sister	1
has	1
resigned	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
chosen	1
partner	1
of	1
her	1
fate	1
may	1
be	1
reasonably	1
looked	1
up	1
to	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
illustrious	1
personages	1
in	1
this	1
land.'	1
"Can	1
you	1
possibly	1
guess,	1
Lizzy,	1
who	1
is	1
meant	1
by	1
this?"	1
'This	1
young	1
gentleman	1
is	1
blessed,	1
in	1
a	1
peculiar	1
way,	1
with	1
every	1
thing	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
mortal	1
can	1
most	1
desire,--splendid	1
property,	1
noble	1
kindred,	1
and	1
extensive	1
patronage.	1
Yet	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
temptations,	1
let	1
me	1
warn	1
my	1
cousin	1
Elizabeth,	1
and	1
yourself,	1
of	1
what	1
evils	1
you	1
may	1
incur	1
by	1
a	1
precipitate	1
closure	1
with	1
this	1
gentleman's	1
proposals,	1
which,	1
of	1
course,	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
inclined	1
to	1
take	1
immediate	1
advantage	1
of.'	1
"Have	1
you	1
any	1
idea,	1
Lizzy,	1
who	1
this	1
gentleman	1
is?	1
But	1
now	1
it	1
comes	1
out:	1
"'My	1
motive	1
for	1
cautioning	1
you	1
is	1
as	1
follows.	1
We	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
his	1
aunt,	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
de	1
Bourgh,	1
does	1
not	1
look	1
on	1
the	1
match	1
with	1
a	1
friendly	1
eye.'	1
"_Mr.	1
Darcy_,	1
you	1
see,	1
is	1
the	1
man!	1
Now,	1
Lizzy,	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
_have_	1
surprised	1
you.	1
Could	1
he,	1
or	1
the	1
Lucases,	1
have	1
pitched	1
on	1
any	1
man	1
within	1
the	1
circle	1
of	1
our	1
acquaintance,	1
whose	1
name	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
lie	1
more	1
effectually	1
to	1
what	1
they	1
related?	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
who	1
never	1
looks	1
at	1
any	1
woman	1
but	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
blemish,	1
and	1
who	1
probably	1
never	1
looked	1
at	1
you	1
in	1
his	1
life!	1
It	1
is	1
admirable!"	1
Elizabeth	1
tried	1
to	1
join	1
in	1
her	1
father's	1
pleasantry,	1
but	1
could	1
only	1
force	1
one	1
most	1
reluctant	1
smile.	1
Never	1
had	1
his	1
wit	1
been	1
directed	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
so	1
little	1
agreeable	1
to	1
her.	1
"Are	1
you	1
not	1
diverted?"	1
"Oh!	1
yes.	1
Pray	1
read	1
on."	1
"'After	1
mentioning	1
the	1
likelihood	1
of	1
this	1
marriage	1
to	1
her	1
ladyship	1
last	1
night,	1
she	1
immediately,	1
with	1
her	1
usual	1
condescension,	1
expressed	1
what	1
she	1
felt	1
on	1
the	1
occasion;	1
when	1
it	1
became	1
apparent,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
score	1
of	1
some	1
family	1
objections	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
cousin,	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
give	1
her	1
consent	1
to	1
what	1
she	1
termed	1
so	1
disgraceful	1
a	1
match.	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
speediest	1
intelligence	1
of	1
this	1
to	1
my	1
cousin,	1
that	1
she	1
and	1
her	1
noble	1
admirer	1
may	1
be	1
aware	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
about,	1
and	1
not	1
run	1
hastily	1
into	1
a	1
marriage	1
which	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
properly	1
sanctioned.'	1
Mr.	1
Collins	1
moreover	1
adds,	1
'I	1
am	1
truly	1
rejoiced	1
that	1
my	1
cousin	1
Lydia's	1
sad	1
business	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
well	1
hushed	1
up,	1
and	1
am	1
only	1
concerned	1
that	1
their	1
living	1
together	1
before	1
the	1
marriage	1
took	1
place	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
generally	1
known.	1
I	1
must	1
not,	1
however,	1
neglect	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
my	1
station,	1
or	1
refrain	1
from	1
declaring	1
my	1
amazement	1
at	1
hearing	1
that	1
you	1
received	1
the	1
young	1
couple	1
into	1
your	1
house	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
married.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
encouragement	1
of	1
vice;	1
and	1
had	1
I	1
been	1
the	1
rector	1
of	1
Longbourn,	1
I	1
should	1
very	1
strenuously	1
have	1
opposed	1
it.	1
You	1
ought	1
certainly	1
to	1
forgive	1
them,	1
as	1
a	1
Christian,	1
but	1
never	1
to	1
admit	1
them	1
in	1
your	1
sight,	1
or	1
allow	1
their	1
names	1
to	1
be	1
mentioned	1
in	1
your	1
hearing.'	1
That	1
is	1
his	1
notion	1
of	1
Christian	1
forgiveness!	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
letter	1
is	1
only	1
about	1
his	1
dear	1
Charlotte's	1
situation,	1
and	1
his	1
expectation	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
olive-branch.	1
But,	1
Lizzy,	1
you	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
enjoy	1
it.	1
You	1
are	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
_missish_,	1
I	1
hope,	1
and	1
pretend	1
to	1
be	1
affronted	1
at	1
an	1
idle	1
report.	1
For	1
what	1
do	1
we	1
live,	1
but	1
to	1
make	1
sport	1
for	1
our	1
neighbours,	1
and	1
laugh	1
at	1
them	1
in	1
our	1
turn?"	1
"Oh!"	1
cried	1
Elizabeth,	1
"I	1
am	1
excessively	1
diverted.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
strange!"	1
"Yes--_that_	1
is	1
what	1
makes	1
it	1
amusing.	1
Had	1
they	1
fixed	1
on	1
any	1
other	1
man	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
nothing;	1
but	1
_his_	1
perfect	1
indifference,	1
and	1
_your_	1
pointed	1
dislike,	1
make	1
it	1
so	1
delightfully	1
absurd!	1
Much	1
as	1
I	1
abominate	1
writing,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
up	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
correspondence	1
for	1
any	1
consideration.	1
Nay,	1
when	1
I	1
read	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
his,	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
giving	1
him	1
the	1
preference	1
even	1
over	1
Wickham,	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
value	1
the	1
impudence	1
and	1
hypocrisy	1
of	1
my	1
son-in-law.	1
And	1
pray,	1
Lizzy,	1
what	1
said	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
about	1
this	1
report?	1
Did	1
she	1
call	1
to	1
refuse	1
her	1
consent?"	1
To	1
this	1
question	1
his	1
daughter	1
replied	1
only	1
with	1
a	1
laugh;	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
asked	1
without	1
the	1
least	1
suspicion,	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
distressed	1
by	1
his	1
repeating	1
it.	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
more	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
feelings	1
appear	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
not.	1
It	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
laugh,	1
when	1
she	1
would	1
rather	1
have	1
cried.	1
Her	1
father	1
had	1
most	1
cruelly	1
mortified	1
her,	1
by	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
indifference,	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
but	1
wonder	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
want	1
of	1
penetration,	1
or	1
fear	1
that	1
perhaps,	1
instead	1
of	1
his	1
seeing	1
too	1
little,	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
fancied	1
too	1
much.	1
Chapter	1
58	1
Instead	1
of	1
receiving	1
any	1
such	1
letter	1
of	1
excuse	1
from	1
his	1
friend,	1
as	1
Elizabeth	1
half	1
expected	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
to	1
do,	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
bring	1
Darcy	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
Longbourn	1
before	1
many	1
days	1
had	1
passed	1
after	1
Lady	1
Catherine's	1
visit.	1
The	1
gentlemen	1
arrived	1
early;	1
and,	1
before	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
of	1
their	1
having	1
seen	1
his	1
aunt,	1
of	1
which	1
her	1
daughter	1
sat	1
in	1
momentary	1
dread,	1
Bingley,	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
alone	1
with	1
Jane,	1
proposed	1
their	1
all	1
walking	1
out.	1
It	1
was	1
agreed	1
to.	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
walking;	1
Mary	1
could	1
never	1
spare	1
time;	1
but	1
the	1
remaining	1
five	1
set	1
off	1
together.	1
Bingley	1
and	1
Jane,	1
however,	1
soon	1
allowed	1
the	1
others	1
to	1
outstrip	1
them.	1
They	1
lagged	1
behind,	1
while	1
Elizabeth,	1
Kitty,	1
and	1
Darcy	1
were	1
to	1
entertain	1
each	1
other.	1
Very	1
little	1
was	1
said	1
by	1
either;	1
Kitty	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
afraid	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
talk;	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
secretly	1
forming	1
a	1
desperate	1
resolution;	1
and	1
perhaps	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
doing	1
the	1
same.	1
They	1
walked	1
towards	1
the	1
Lucases,	1
because	1
Kitty	1
wished	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
Maria;	1
and	1
as	1
Elizabeth	1
saw	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
making	1
it	1
a	1
general	1
concern,	1
when	1
Kitty	1
left	1
them	1
she	1
went	1
boldly	1
on	1
with	1
him	1
alone.	1
Now	1
was	1
the	1
moment	1
for	1
her	1
resolution	1
to	1
be	1
executed,	1
and,	1
while	1
her	1
courage	1
was	1
high,	1
she	1
immediately	1
said:	1
"Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
very	1
selfish	1
creature;	1
and,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
giving	1
relief	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
feelings,	1
care	1
not	1
how	1
much	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
wounding	1
yours.	1
I	1
can	1
no	1
longer	1
help	1
thanking	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
unexampled	1
kindness	1
to	1
my	1
poor	1
sister.	1
Ever	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
it,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
most	1
anxious	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
to	1
you	1
how	1
gratefully	1
I	1
feel	1
it.	1
Were	1
it	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
my	1
family,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
merely	1
my	1
own	1
gratitude	1
to	1
express."	1
"I	1
am	1
sorry,	1
exceedingly	1
sorry,"	1
replied	1
Darcy,	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
surprise	1
and	1
emotion,	1
"that	1
you	1
have	1
ever	1
been	1
informed	1
of	1
what	1
may,	1
in	1
a	1
mistaken	1
light,	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
uneasiness.	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner	1
was	1
so	1
little	1
to	1
be	1
trusted."	1
"You	1
must	1
not	1
blame	1
my	1
aunt.	1
Lydia's	1
thoughtlessness	1
first	1
betrayed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
concerned	1
in	1
the	1
matter;	1
and,	1
of	1
course,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
rest	1
till	1
I	1
knew	1
the	1
particulars.	1
Let	1
me	1
thank	1
you	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
family,	1
for	1
that	1
generous	1
compassion	1
which	1
induced	1
you	1
to	1
take	1
so	1
much	1
trouble,	1
and	1
bear	1
so	1
many	1
mortifications,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
discovering	1
them."	1
"If	1
you	1
_will_	1
thank	1
me,"	1
he	1
replied,	1
"let	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
yourself	1
alone.	1
That	1
the	1
wish	1
of	1
giving	1
happiness	1
to	1
you	1
might	1
add	1
force	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
inducements	1
which	1
led	1
me	1
on,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
attempt	1
to	1
deny.	1
But	1
your	1
_family_	1
owe	1
me	1
nothing.	1
Much	1
as	1
I	1
respect	1
them,	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
thought	1
only	1
of	1
_you_."	1
Elizabeth	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
embarrassed	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
word.	1
After	1
a	1
short	1
pause,	1
her	1
companion	1
added,	1
"You	1
are	1
too	1
generous	1
to	1
trifle	1
with	1
me.	1
If	1
your	1
feelings	1
are	1
still	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
last	1
April,	1
tell	1
me	1
so	1
at	1
once.	1
_My_	1
affections	1
and	1
wishes	1
are	1
unchanged,	1
but	1
one	1
word	1
from	1
you	1
will	1
silence	1
me	1
on	1
this	1
subject	1
for	1
ever."	1
Elizabeth,	1
feeling	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
than	1
common	1
awkwardness	1
and	1
anxiety	1
of	1
his	1
situation,	1
now	1
forced	1
herself	1
to	1
speak;	1
and	1
immediately,	1
though	1
not	1
very	1
fluently,	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
her	1
sentiments	1
had	1
undergone	1
so	1
material	1
a	1
change,	1
since	1
the	1
period	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
alluded,	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
receive	1
with	1
gratitude	1
and	1
pleasure	1
his	1
present	1
assurances.	1
The	1
happiness	1
which	1
this	1
reply	1
produced,	1
was	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
probably	1
never	1
felt	1
before;	1
and	1
he	1
expressed	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
occasion	1
as	1
sensibly	1
and	1
as	1
warmly	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
violently	1
in	1
love	1
can	1
be	1
supposed	1
to	1
do.	1
Had	1
Elizabeth	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
encounter	1
his	1
eye,	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
seen	1
how	1
well	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
heartfelt	1
delight,	1
diffused	1
over	1
his	1
face,	1
became	1
him;	1
but,	1
though	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
look,	1
she	1
could	1
listen,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
of	1
feelings,	1
which,	1
in	1
proving	1
of	1
what	1
importance	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
him,	1
made	1
his	1
affection	1
every	1
moment	1
more	1
valuable.	1
They	1
walked	1
on,	1
without	1
knowing	1
in	1
what	1
direction.	1
There	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
thought,	1
and	1
felt,	1
and	1
said,	1
for	1
attention	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
objects.	1
She	1
soon	1
learnt	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
indebted	1
for	1
their	1
present	1
good	1
understanding	1
to	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
his	1
aunt,	1
who	1
did	1
call	1
on	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
return	1
through	1
London,	1
and	1
there	1
relate	1
her	1
journey	1
to	1
Longbourn,	1
its	1
motive,	1
and	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
her	1
conversation	1
with	1
Elizabeth;	1
dwelling	1
emphatically	1
on	1
every	1
expression	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
which,	1
in	1
her	1
ladyship's	1
apprehension,	1
peculiarly	1
denoted	1
her	1
perverseness	1
and	1
assurance;	1
in	1
the	1
belief	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
relation	1
must	1
assist	1
her	1
endeavours	1
to	1
obtain	1
that	1
promise	1
from	1
her	1
nephew	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
refused	1
to	1
give.	1
But,	1
unluckily	1
for	1
her	1
ladyship,	1
its	1
effect	1
had	1
been	1
exactly	1
contrariwise.	1
"It	1
taught	1
me	1
to	1
hope,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"as	1
I	1
had	1
scarcely	1
ever	1
allowed	1
myself	1
to	1
hope	1
before.	1
I	1
knew	1
enough	1
of	1
your	1
disposition	1
to	1
be	1
certain	1
that,	1
had	1
you	1
been	1
absolutely,	1
irrevocably	1
decided	1
against	1
me,	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
acknowledged	1
it	1
to	1
Lady	1
Catherine,	1
frankly	1
and	1
openly."	1
Elizabeth	1
coloured	1
and	1
laughed	1
as	1
she	1
replied,	1
"Yes,	1
you	1
know	1
enough	1
of	1
my	1
frankness	1
to	1
believe	1
me	1
capable	1
of	1
_that_.	1
After	1
abusing	1
you	1
so	1
abominably	1
to	1
your	1
face,	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
no	1
scruple	1
in	1
abusing	1
you	1
to	1
all	1
your	1
relations."	1
"What	1
did	1
you	1
say	1
of	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
deserve?	1
For,	1
though	1
your	1
accusations	1
were	1
ill-founded,	1
formed	1
on	1
mistaken	1
premises,	1
my	1
behaviour	1
to	1
you	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
merited	1
the	1
severest	1
reproof.	1
It	1
was	1
unpardonable.	1
I	1
cannot	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
without	1
abhorrence."	1
"We	1
will	1
not	1
quarrel	1
for	1
the	1
greater	1
share	1
of	1
blame	1
annexed	1
to	1
that	1
evening,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth.	1
"The	1
conduct	1
of	1
neither,	1
if	1
strictly	1
examined,	1
will	1
be	1
irreproachable;	1
but	1
since	1
then,	1
we	1
have	1
both,	1
I	1
hope,	1
improved	1
in	1
civility."	1
"I	1
cannot	1
be	1
so	1
easily	1
reconciled	1
to	1
myself.	1
The	1
recollection	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
then	1
said,	1
of	1
my	1
conduct,	1
my	1
manners,	1
my	1
expressions	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
it,	1
is	1
now,	1
and	1
has	1
been	1
many	1
months,	1
inexpressibly	1
painful	1
to	1
me.	1
Your	1
reproof,	1
so	1
well	1
applied,	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
forget:	1
'had	1
you	1
behaved	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
gentlemanlike	1
manner.'	1
Those	1
were	1
your	1
words.	1
You	1
know	1
not,	1
you	1
can	1
scarcely	1
conceive,	1
how	1
they	1
have	1
tortured	1
me;--though	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
time,	1
I	1
confess,	1
before	1
I	1
was	1
reasonable	1
enough	1
to	1
allow	1
their	1
justice."	1
"I	1
was	1
certainly	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
expecting	1
them	1
to	1
make	1
so	1
strong	1
an	1
impression.	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
smallest	1
idea	1
of	1
their	1
being	1
ever	1
felt	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way."	1
"I	1
can	1
easily	1
believe	1
it.	1
You	1
thought	1
me	1
then	1
devoid	1
of	1
every	1
proper	1
feeling,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
you	1
did.	1
The	1
turn	1
of	1
your	1
countenance	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
forget,	1
as	1
you	1
said	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
addressed	1
you	1
in	1
any	1
possible	1
way	1
that	1
would	1
induce	1
you	1
to	1
accept	1
me."	1
"Oh!	1
do	1
not	1
repeat	1
what	1
I	1
then	1
said.	1
These	1
recollections	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
at	1
all.	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
long	1
been	1
most	1
heartily	1
ashamed	1
of	1
it."	1
Darcy	1
mentioned	1
his	1
letter.	1
"Did	1
it,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"did	1
it	1
soon	1
make	1
you	1
think	1
better	1
of	1
me?	1
Did	1
you,	1
on	1
reading	1
it,	1
give	1
any	1
credit	1
to	1
its	1
contents?"	1
She	1
explained	1
what	1
its	1
effect	1
on	1
her	1
had	1
been,	1
and	1
how	1
gradually	1
all	1
her	1
former	1
prejudices	1
had	1
been	1
removed.	1
"I	1
knew,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"that	1
what	1
I	1
wrote	1
must	1
give	1
you	1
pain,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
necessary.	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
have	1
destroyed	1
the	1
letter.	1
There	1
was	1
one	1
part	1
especially,	1
the	1
opening	1
of	1
it,	1
which	1
I	1
should	1
dread	1
your	1
having	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
reading	1
again.	1
I	1
can	1
remember	1
some	1
expressions	1
which	1
might	1
justly	1
make	1
you	1
hate	1
me."	1
"The	1
letter	1
shall	1
certainly	1
be	1
burnt,	1
if	1
you	1
believe	1
it	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
preservation	1
of	1
my	1
regard;	1
but,	1
though	1
we	1
have	1
both	1
reason	1
to	1
think	1
my	1
opinions	1
not	1
entirely	1
unalterable,	1
they	1
are	1
not,	1
I	1
hope,	1
quite	1
so	1
easily	1
changed	1
as	1
that	1
implies."	1
"When	1
I	1
wrote	1
that	1
letter,"	1
replied	1
Darcy,	1
"I	1
believed	1
myself	1
perfectly	1
calm	1
and	1
cool,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
since	1
convinced	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
in	1
a	1
dreadful	1
bitterness	1
of	1
spirit."	1
"The	1
letter,	1
perhaps,	1
began	1
in	1
bitterness,	1
but	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
end	1
so.	1
The	1
adieu	1
is	1
charity	1
itself.	1
But	1
think	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
letter.	1
The	1
feelings	1
of	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
wrote,	1
and	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
received	1
it,	1
are	1
now	1
so	1
widely	1
different	1
from	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
then,	1
that	1
every	1
unpleasant	1
circumstance	1
attending	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
forgotten.	1
You	1
must	1
learn	1
some	1
of	1
my	1
philosophy.	1
Think	1
only	1
of	1
the	1
past	1
as	1
its	1
remembrance	1
gives	1
you	1
pleasure."	1
"I	1
cannot	1
give	1
you	1
credit	1
for	1
any	1
philosophy	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
Your	1
retrospections	1
must	1
be	1
so	1
totally	1
void	1
of	1
reproach,	1
that	1
the	1
contentment	1
arising	1
from	1
them	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
philosophy,	1
but,	1
what	1
is	1
much	1
better,	1
of	1
innocence.	1
But	1
with	1
me,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so.	1
Painful	1
recollections	1
will	1
intrude	1
which	1
cannot,	1
which	1
ought	1
not,	1
to	1
be	1
repelled.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
selfish	1
being	1
all	1
my	1
life,	1
in	1
practice,	1
though	1
not	1
in	1
principle.	1
As	1
a	1
child	1
I	1
was	1
taught	1
what	1
was	1
right,	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
taught	1
to	1
correct	1
my	1
temper.	1
I	1
was	1
given	1
good	1
principles,	1
but	1
left	1
to	1
follow	1
them	1
in	1
pride	1
and	1
conceit.	1
Unfortunately	1
an	1
only	1
son	1
(for	1
many	1
years	1
an	1
only	1
child),	1
I	1
was	1
spoilt	1
by	1
my	1
parents,	1
who,	1
though	1
good	1
themselves	1
(my	1
father,	1
particularly,	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
benevolent	1
and	1
amiable),	1
allowed,	1
encouraged,	1
almost	1
taught	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
selfish	1
and	1
overbearing;	1
to	1
care	1
for	1
none	1
beyond	1
my	1
own	1
family	1
circle;	1
to	1
think	1
meanly	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
world;	1
to	1
wish	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
think	1
meanly	1
of	1
their	1
sense	1
and	1
worth	1
compared	1
with	1
my	1
own.	1
Such	1
I	1
was,	1
from	1
eight	1
to	1
eight	1
and	1
twenty;	1
and	1
such	1
I	1
might	1
still	1
have	1
been	1
but	1
for	1
you,	1
dearest,	1
loveliest	1
Elizabeth!	1
What	1
do	1
I	1
not	1
owe	1
you!	1
You	1
taught	1
me	1
a	1
lesson,	1
hard	1
indeed	1
at	1
first,	1
but	1
most	1
advantageous.	1
By	1
you,	1
I	1
was	1
properly	1
humbled.	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
you	1
without	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
my	1
reception.	1
You	1
showed	1
me	1
how	1
insufficient	1
were	1
all	1
my	1
pretensions	1
to	1
please	1
a	1
woman	1
worthy	1
of	1
being	1
pleased."	1
"Had	1
you	1
then	1
persuaded	1
yourself	1
that	1
I	1
should?"	1
"Indeed	1
I	1
had.	1
What	1
will	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
my	1
vanity?	1
I	1
believed	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
wishing,	1
expecting	1
my	1
addresses."	1
"My	1
manners	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
fault,	1
but	1
not	1
intentionally,	1
I	1
assure	1
you.	1
I	1
never	1
meant	1
to	1
deceive	1
you,	1
but	1
my	1
spirits	1
might	1
often	1
lead	1
me	1
wrong.	1
How	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
hated	1
me	1
after	1
_that_	1
evening?"	1
"Hate	1
you!	1
I	1
was	1
angry	1
perhaps	1
at	1
first,	1
but	1
my	1
anger	1
soon	1
began	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
proper	1
direction."	1
"I	1
am	1
almost	1
afraid	1
of	1
asking	1
what	1
you	1
thought	1
of	1
me,	1
when	1
we	1
met	1
at	1
Pemberley.	1
You	1
blamed	1
me	1
for	1
coming?"	1
"No	1
indeed;	1
I	1
felt	1
nothing	1
but	1
surprise."	1
"Your	1
surprise	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
greater	1
than	1
_mine_	1
in	1
being	1
noticed	1
by	1
you.	1
My	1
conscience	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
deserved	1
no	1
extraordinary	1
politeness,	1
and	1
I	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
to	1
receive	1
_more_	1
than	1
my	1
due."	1
"My	1
object	1
then,"	1
replied	1
Darcy,	1
"was	1
to	1
show	1
you,	1
by	1
every	1
civility	1
in	1
my	1
power,	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
mean	1
as	1
to	1
resent	1
the	1
past;	1
and	1
I	1
hoped	1
to	1
obtain	1
your	1
forgiveness,	1
to	1
lessen	1
your	1
ill	1
opinion,	1
by	1
letting	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
your	1
reproofs	1
had	1
been	1
attended	1
to.	1
How	1
soon	1
any	1
other	1
wishes	1
introduced	1
themselves	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
tell,	1
but	1
I	1
believe	1
in	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
you."	1
He	1
then	1
told	1
her	1
of	1
Georgiana's	1
delight	1
in	1
her	1
acquaintance,	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
disappointment	1
at	1
its	1
sudden	1
interruption;	1
which	1
naturally	1
leading	1
to	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
that	1
interruption,	1
she	1
soon	1
learnt	1
that	1
his	1
resolution	1
of	1
following	1
her	1
from	1
Derbyshire	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
her	1
sister	1
had	1
been	1
formed	1
before	1
he	1
quitted	1
the	1
inn,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
gravity	1
and	1
thoughtfulness	1
there	1
had	1
arisen	1
from	1
no	1
other	1
struggles	1
than	1
what	1
such	1
a	1
purpose	1
must	1
comprehend.	1
She	1
expressed	1
her	1
gratitude	1
again,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
painful	1
a	1
subject	1
to	1
each,	1
to	1
be	1
dwelt	1
on	1
farther.	1
After	1
walking	1
several	1
miles	1
in	1
a	1
leisurely	1
manner,	1
and	1
too	1
busy	1
to	1
know	1
anything	1
about	1
it,	1
they	1
found	1
at	1
last,	1
on	1
examining	1
their	1
watches,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
home.	1
"What	1
could	1
become	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
and	1
Jane!"	1
was	1
a	1
wonder	1
which	1
introduced	1
the	1
discussion	1
of	1
their	1
affairs.	1
Darcy	1
was	1
delighted	1
with	1
their	1
engagement;	1
his	1
friend	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
the	1
earliest	1
information	1
of	1
it.	1
"I	1
must	1
ask	1
whether	1
you	1
were	1
surprised?"	1
said	1
Elizabeth.	1
"Not	1
at	1
all.	1
When	1
I	1
went	1
away,	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
soon	1
happen."	1
"That	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
you	1
had	1
given	1
your	1
permission.	1
I	1
guessed	1
as	1
much."	1
And	1
though	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
at	1
the	1
term,	1
she	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
pretty	1
much	1
the	1
case.	1
"On	1
the	1
evening	1
before	1
my	1
going	1
to	1
London,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"I	1
made	1
a	1
confession	1
to	1
him,	1
which	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
made	1
long	1
ago.	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
occurred	1
to	1
make	1
my	1
former	1
interference	1
in	1
his	1
affairs	1
absurd	1
and	1
impertinent.	1
His	1
surprise	1
was	1
great.	1
He	1
had	1
never	1
had	1
the	1
slightest	1
suspicion.	1
I	1
told	1
him,	1
moreover,	1
that	1
I	1
believed	1
myself	1
mistaken	1
in	1
supposing,	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
done,	1
that	1
your	1
sister	1
was	1
indifferent	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
easily	1
perceive	1
that	1
his	1
attachment	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
unabated,	1
I	1
felt	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
their	1
happiness	1
together."	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
smiling	1
at	1
his	1
easy	1
manner	1
of	1
directing	1
his	1
friend.	1
"Did	1
you	1
speak	1
from	1
your	1
own	1
observation,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"when	1
you	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
my	1
sister	1
loved	1
him,	1
or	1
merely	1
from	1
my	1
information	1
last	1
spring?"	1
"From	1
the	1
former.	1
I	1
had	1
narrowly	1
observed	1
her	1
during	1
the	1
two	1
visits	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
lately	1
made	1
here;	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
convinced	1
of	1
her	1
affection."	1
"And	1
your	1
assurance	1
of	1
it,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
carried	1
immediate	1
conviction	1
to	1
him."	1
"It	1
did.	1
Bingley	1
is	1
most	1
unaffectedly	1
modest.	1
His	1
diffidence	1
had	1
prevented	1
his	1
depending	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
judgment	1
in	1
so	1
anxious	1
a	1
case,	1
but	1
his	1
reliance	1
on	1
mine	1
made	1
every	1
thing	1
easy.	1
I	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
confess	1
one	1
thing,	1
which	1
for	1
a	1
time,	1
and	1
not	1
unjustly,	1
offended	1
him.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
allow	1
myself	1
to	1
conceal	1
that	1
your	1
sister	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
town	1
three	1
months	1
last	1
winter,	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
known	1
it,	1
and	1
purposely	1
kept	1
it	1
from	1
him.	1
He	1
was	1
angry.	1
But	1
his	1
anger,	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded,	1
lasted	1
no	1
longer	1
than	1
he	1
remained	1
in	1
any	1
doubt	1
of	1
your	1
sister's	1
sentiments.	1
He	1
has	1
heartily	1
forgiven	1
me	1
now."	1
Elizabeth	1
longed	1
to	1
observe	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
most	1
delightful	1
friend;	1
so	1
easily	1
guided	1
that	1
his	1
worth	1
was	1
invaluable;	1
but	1
she	1
checked	1
herself.	1
She	1
remembered	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
yet	1
to	1
learn	1
to	1
be	1
laughed	1
at,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
rather	1
too	1
early	1
to	1
begin.	1
In	1
anticipating	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
Bingley,	1
which	1
of	1
course	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
inferior	1
only	1
to	1
his	1
own,	1
he	1
continued	1
the	1
conversation	1
till	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
house.	1
In	1
the	1
hall	1
they	1
parted.	1
Chapter	1
59	1
"My	1
dear	1
Lizzy,	1
where	1
can	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
walking	1
to?"	1
was	1
a	1
question	1
which	1
Elizabeth	1
received	1
from	1
Jane	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
entered	1
their	1
room,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
when	1
they	1
sat	1
down	1
to	1
table.	1
She	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
reply,	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
wandered	1
about,	1
till	1
she	1
was	1
beyond	1
her	1
own	1
knowledge.	1
She	1
coloured	1
as	1
she	1
spoke;	1
but	1
neither	1
that,	1
nor	1
anything	1
else,	1
awakened	1
a	1
suspicion	1
of	1
the	1
truth.	1
The	1
evening	1
passed	1
quietly,	1
unmarked	1
by	1
anything	1
extraordinary.	1
The	1
acknowledged	1
lovers	1
talked	1
and	1
laughed,	1
the	1
unacknowledged	1
were	1
silent.	1
Darcy	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
disposition	1
in	1
which	1
happiness	1
overflows	1
in	1
mirth;	1
and	1
Elizabeth,	1
agitated	1
and	1
confused,	1
rather	1
_knew_	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
happy	1
than	1
_felt_	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
so;	1
for,	1
besides	1
the	1
immediate	1
embarrassment,	1
there	1
were	1
other	1
evils	1
before	1
her.	1
She	1
anticipated	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
felt	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
when	1
her	1
situation	1
became	1
known;	1
she	1
was	1
aware	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
liked	1
him	1
but	1
Jane;	1
and	1
even	1
feared	1
that	1
with	1
the	1
others	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
dislike	1
which	1
not	1
all	1
his	1
fortune	1
and	1
consequence	1
might	1
do	1
away.	1
At	1
night	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
heart	1
to	1
Jane.	1
Though	1
suspicion	1
was	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
Miss	1
Bennet's	1
general	1
habits,	1
she	1
was	1
absolutely	1
incredulous	1
here.	1
"You	1
are	1
joking,	1
Lizzy.	1
This	1
cannot	1
be!--engaged	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Darcy!	1
No,	1
no,	1
you	1
shall	1
not	1
deceive	1
me.	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
impossible."	1
"This	1
is	1
a	1
wretched	1
beginning	1
indeed!	1
My	1
sole	1
dependence	1
was	1
on	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
nobody	1
else	1
will	1
believe	1
me,	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not.	1
Yet,	1
indeed,	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
earnest.	1
I	1
speak	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
truth.	1
He	1
still	1
loves	1
me,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
engaged."	1
Jane	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
doubtingly.	1
"Oh,	1
Lizzy!	1
it	1
cannot	1
be.	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
much	1
you	1
dislike	1
him."	1
"You	1
know	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
_That_	1
is	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
forgot.	1
Perhaps	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
always	1
love	1
him	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
now.	1
But	1
in	1
such	1
cases	1
as	1
these,	1
a	1
good	1
memory	1
is	1
unpardonable.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
I	1
shall	1
ever	1
remember	1
it	1
myself."	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
still	1
looked	1
all	1
amazement.	1
Elizabeth	1
again,	1
and	1
more	1
seriously	1
assured	1
her	1
of	1
its	1
truth.	1
"Good	1
Heaven!	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
really	1
so!	1
Yet	1
now	1
I	1
must	1
believe	1
you,"	1
cried	1
Jane.	1
"My	1
dear,	1
dear	1
Lizzy,	1
I	1
would--I	1
do	1
congratulate	1
you--but	1
are	1
you	1
certain?	1
forgive	1
the	1
question--are	1
you	1
quite	1
certain	1
that	1
you	1
can	1
be	1
happy	1
with	1
him?"	1
"There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
that.	1
It	1
is	1
settled	1
between	1
us	1
already,	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
happiest	1
couple	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
But	1
are	1
you	1
pleased,	1
Jane?	1
Shall	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
brother?"	1
"Very,	1
very	1
much.	1
Nothing	1
could	1
give	1
either	1
Bingley	1
or	1
myself	1
more	1
delight.	1
But	1
we	1
considered	1
it,	1
we	1
talked	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
impossible.	1
And	1
do	1
you	1
really	1
love	1
him	1
quite	1
well	1
enough?	1
Oh,	1
Lizzy!	1
do	1
anything	1
rather	1
than	1
marry	1
without	1
affection.	1
Are	1
you	1
quite	1
sure	1
that	1
you	1
feel	1
what	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
do?"	1
"Oh,	1
yes!	1
You	1
will	1
only	1
think	1
I	1
feel	1
_more_	1
than	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
do,	1
when	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
all."	1
"What	1
do	1
you	1
mean?"	1
"Why,	1
I	1
must	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
him	1
better	1
than	1
I	1
do	1
Bingley.	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
angry."	1
"My	1
dearest	1
sister,	1
now	1
_be_	1
serious.	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
talk	1
very	1
seriously.	1
Let	1
me	1
know	1
every	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
know,	1
without	1
delay.	1
Will	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
long	1
you	1
have	1
loved	1
him?"	1
"It	1
has	1
been	1
coming	1
on	1
so	1
gradually,	1
that	1
I	1
hardly	1
know	1
when	1
it	1
began.	1
But	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
must	1
date	1
it	1
from	1
my	1
first	1
seeing	1
his	1
beautiful	1
grounds	1
at	1
Pemberley."	1
Another	1
entreaty	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
serious,	1
however,	1
produced	1
the	1
desired	1
effect;	1
and	1
she	1
soon	1
satisfied	1
Jane	1
by	1
her	1
solemn	1
assurances	1
of	1
attachment.	1
When	1
convinced	1
on	1
that	1
article,	1
Miss	1
Bennet	1
had	1
nothing	1
further	1
to	1
wish.	1
"Now	1
I	1
am	1
quite	1
happy,"	1
said	1
she,	1
"for	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
happy	1
as	1
myself.	1
I	1
always	1
had	1
a	1
value	1
for	1
him.	1
Were	1
it	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
his	1
love	1
of	1
you,	1
I	1
must	1
always	1
have	1
esteemed	1
him;	1
but	1
now,	1
as	1
Bingley's	1
friend	1
and	1
your	1
husband,	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
only	1
Bingley	1
and	1
yourself	1
more	1
dear	1
to	1
me.	1
But	1
Lizzy,	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
sly,	1
very	1
reserved	1
with	1
me.	1
How	1
little	1
did	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
of	1
what	1
passed	1
at	1
Pemberley	1
and	1
Lambton!	1
I	1
owe	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
another,	1
not	1
to	1
you."	1
Elizabeth	1
told	1
her	1
the	1
motives	1
of	1
her	1
secrecy.	1
She	1
had	1
been	1
unwilling	1
to	1
mention	1
Bingley;	1
and	1
the	1
unsettled	1
state	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
feelings	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
equally	1
avoid	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
friend.	1
But	1
now	1
she	1
would	1
no	1
longer	1
conceal	1
from	1
her	1
his	1
share	1
in	1
Lydia's	1
marriage.	1
All	1
was	1
acknowledged,	1
and	1
half	1
the	1
night	1
spent	1
in	1
conversation.	1
*	1

"Good	1
gracious!"	1
cried	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
at	1
a	1
window	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
"if	1
that	1
disagreeable	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
is	1
not	1
coming	1
here	1
again	1
with	1
our	1
dear	1
Bingley!	1
What	1
can	1
he	1
mean	1
by	1
being	1
so	1
tiresome	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
coming	1
here?	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
notion	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
a-shooting,	1
or	1
something	1
or	1
other,	1
and	1
not	1
disturb	1
us	1
with	1
his	1
company.	1
What	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
with	1
him?	1
Lizzy,	1
you	1
must	1
walk	1
out	1
with	1
him	1
again,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
Bingley's	1
way."	1
Elizabeth	1
could	1
hardly	1
help	1
laughing	1
at	1
so	1
convenient	1
a	1
proposal;	1
yet	1
was	1
really	1
vexed	1
that	1
her	1
mother	1
should	1
be	1
always	1
giving	1
him	1
such	1
an	1
epithet.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
entered,	1
Bingley	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
so	1
expressively,	1
and	1
shook	1
hands	1
with	1
such	1
warmth,	1
as	1
left	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
information;	1
and	1
he	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
said	1
aloud,	1
"Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
have	1
you	1
no	1
more	1
lanes	1
hereabouts	1
in	1
which	1
Lizzy	1
may	1
lose	1
her	1
way	1
again	1
to-day?"	1
"I	1
advise	1
Mr.	1
Darcy,	1
and	1
Lizzy,	1
and	1
Kitty,"	1
said	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet,	1
"to	1
walk	1
to	1
Oakham	1
Mount	1
this	1
morning.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
nice	1
long	1
walk,	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
has	1
never	1
seen	1
the	1
view."	1
"It	1
may	1
do	1
very	1
well	1
for	1
the	1
others,"	1
replied	1
Mr.	1
Bingley;	1
"but	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
too	1
much	1
for	1
Kitty.	1
Won't	1
it,	1
Kitty?"	1
Kitty	1
owned	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
rather	1
stay	1
at	1
home.	1
Darcy	1
professed	1
a	1
great	1
curiosity	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
view	1
from	1
the	1
Mount,	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
silently	1
consented.	1
As	1
she	1
went	1
up	1
stairs	1
to	1
get	1
ready,	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
followed	1
her,	1
saying:	1
"I	1
am	1
quite	1
sorry,	1
Lizzy,	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
forced	1
to	1
have	1
that	1
disagreeable	1
man	1
all	1
to	1
yourself.	1
But	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
mind	1
it:	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
for	1
Jane's	1
sake,	1
you	1
know;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
talking	1
to	1
him,	1
except	1
just	1
now	1
and	1
then.	1
So,	1
do	1
not	1
put	1
yourself	1
to	1
inconvenience."	1
During	1
their	1
walk,	1
it	1
was	1
resolved	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Bennet's	1
consent	1
should	1
be	1
asked	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
evening.	1
Elizabeth	1
reserved	1
to	1
herself	1
the	1
application	1
for	1
her	1
mother's.	1
She	1
could	1
not	1
determine	1
how	1
her	1
mother	1
would	1
take	1
it;	1
sometimes	1
doubting	1
whether	1
all	1
his	1
wealth	1
and	1
grandeur	1
would	1
be	1
enough	1
to	1
overcome	1
her	1
abhorrence	1
of	1
the	1
man.	1
But	1
whether	1
she	1
were	1
violently	1
set	1
against	1
the	1
match,	1
or	1
violently	1
delighted	1
with	1
it,	1
it	1
was	1
certain	1
that	1
her	1
manner	1
would	1
be	1
equally	1
ill	1
adapted	1
to	1
do	1
credit	1
to	1
her	1
sense;	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
no	1
more	1
bear	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
should	1
hear	1
the	1
first	1
raptures	1
of	1
her	1
joy,	1
than	1
the	1
first	1
vehemence	1
of	1
her	1
disapprobation.	1

In	1
the	1
evening,	1
soon	1
after	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
withdrew	1
to	1
the	1
library,	1
she	1
saw	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
rise	1
also	1
and	1
follow	1
him,	1
and	1
her	1
agitation	1
on	1
seeing	1
it	1
was	1
extreme.	1
She	1
did	1
not	1
fear	1
her	1
father's	1
opposition,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
unhappy;	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
through	1
her	1
means--that	1
_she_,	1
his	1
favourite	1
child,	1
should	1
be	1
distressing	1
him	1
by	1
her	1
choice,	1
should	1
be	1
filling	1
him	1
with	1
fears	1
and	1
regrets	1
in	1
disposing	1
of	1
her--was	1
a	1
wretched	1
reflection,	1
and	1
she	1
sat	1
in	1
misery	1
till	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
appeared	1
again,	1
when,	1
looking	1
at	1
him,	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
relieved	1
by	1
his	1
smile.	1
In	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
table	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
Kitty;	1
and,	1
while	1
pretending	1
to	1
admire	1
her	1
work	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper,	1
"Go	1
to	1
your	1
father,	1
he	1
wants	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
library."	1
She	1
was	1
gone	1
directly.	1
Her	1
father	1
was	1
walking	1
about	1
the	1
room,	1
looking	1
grave	1
and	1
anxious.	1
"Lizzy,"	1
said	1
he,	1
"what	1
are	1
you	1
doing?	1
Are	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
senses,	1
to	1
be	1
accepting	1
this	1
man?	1
Have	1
not	1
you	1
always	1
hated	1
him?"	1
How	1
earnestly	1
did	1
she	1
then	1
wish	1
that	1
her	1
former	1
opinions	1
had	1
been	1
more	1
reasonable,	1
her	1
expressions	1
more	1
moderate!	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
spared	1
her	1
from	1
explanations	1
and	1
professions	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
exceedingly	1
awkward	1
to	1
give;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
now	1
necessary,	1
and	1
she	1
assured	1
him,	1
with	1
some	1
confusion,	1
of	1
her	1
attachment	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Darcy.	1
"Or,	1
in	1
other	1
words,	1
you	1
are	1
determined	1
to	1
have	1
him.	1
He	1
is	1
rich,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
more	1
fine	1
clothes	1
and	1
fine	1
carriages	1
than	1
Jane.	1
But	1
will	1
they	1
make	1
you	1
happy?"	1
"Have	1
you	1
any	1
other	1
objection,"	1
said	1
Elizabeth,	1
"than	1
your	1
belief	1
of	1
my	1
indifference?"	1
"None	1
at	1
all.	1
We	1
all	1
know	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
proud,	1
unpleasant	1
sort	1
of	1
man;	1
but	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
nothing	1
if	1
you	1
really	1
liked	1
him."	1
"I	1
do,	1
I	1
do	1
like	1
him,"	1
she	1
replied,	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
eyes,	1
"I	1
love	1
him.	1
Indeed	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
improper	1
pride.	1
He	1
is	1
perfectly	1
amiable.	1
You	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
really	1
is;	1
then	1
pray	1
do	1
not	1
pain	1
me	1
by	1
speaking	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
terms."	1
"Lizzy,"	1
said	1
her	1
father,	1
"I	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
my	1
consent.	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
man,	1
indeed,	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
dare	1
refuse	1
anything,	1
which	1
he	1
condescended	1
to	1
ask.	1
I	1
now	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
_you_,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
resolved	1
on	1
having	1
him.	1
But	1
let	1
me	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
think	1
better	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
disposition,	1
Lizzy.	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
be	1
neither	1
happy	1
nor	1
respectable,	1
unless	1
you	1
truly	1
esteemed	1
your	1
husband;	1
unless	1
you	1
looked	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
superior.	1
Your	1
lively	1
talents	1
would	1
place	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
danger	1
in	1
an	1
unequal	1
marriage.	1
You	1
could	1
scarcely	1
escape	1
discredit	1
and	1
misery.	1
My	1
child,	1
let	1
me	1
not	1
have	1
the	1
grief	1
of	1
seeing	1
_you_	1
unable	1
to	1
respect	1
your	1
partner	1
in	1
life.	1
You	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
about."	1
Elizabeth,	1
still	1
more	1
affected,	1
was	1
earnest	1
and	1
solemn	1
in	1
her	1
reply;	1
and	1
at	1
length,	1
by	1
repeated	1
assurances	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
was	1
really	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
her	1
choice,	1
by	1
explaining	1
the	1
gradual	1
change	1
which	1
her	1
estimation	1
of	1
him	1
had	1
undergone,	1
relating	1
her	1
absolute	1
certainty	1
that	1
his	1
affection	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
a	1
day,	1
but	1
had	1
stood	1
the	1
test	1
of	1
many	1
months'	1
suspense,	1
and	1
enumerating	1
with	1
energy	1
all	1
his	1
good	1
qualities,	1
she	1
did	1
conquer	1
her	1
father's	1
incredulity,	1
and	1
reconcile	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
match.	1
"Well,	1
my	1
dear,"	1
said	1
he,	1
when	1
she	1
ceased	1
speaking,	1
"I	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
say.	1
If	1
this	1
be	1
the	1
case,	1
he	1
deserves	1
you.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
parted	1
with	1
you,	1
my	1
Lizzy,	1
to	1
anyone	1
less	1
worthy."	1
To	1
complete	1
the	1
favourable	1
impression,	1
she	1
then	1
told	1
him	1
what	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
had	1
voluntarily	1
done	1
for	1
Lydia.	1
He	1
heard	1
her	1
with	1
astonishment.	1
"This	1
is	1
an	1
evening	1
of	1
wonders,	1
indeed!	1
And	1
so,	1
Darcy	1
did	1
every	1
thing;	1
made	1
up	1
the	1
match,	1
gave	1
the	1
money,	1
paid	1
the	1
fellow's	1
debts,	1
and	1
got	1
him	1
his	1
commission!	1
So	1
much	1
the	1
better.	1
It	1
will	1
save	1
me	1
a	1
world	1
of	1
trouble	1
and	1
economy.	1
Had	1
it	1
been	1
your	1
uncle's	1
doing,	1
I	1
must	1
and	1
_would_	1
have	1
paid	1
him;	1
but	1
these	1
violent	1
young	1
lovers	1
carry	1
every	1
thing	1
their	1
own	1
way.	1
I	1
shall	1
offer	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
to-morrow;	1
he	1
will	1
rant	1
and	1
storm	1
about	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
matter."	1
He	1
then	1
recollected	1
her	1
embarrassment	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before,	1
on	1
his	1
reading	1
Mr.	1
Collins's	1
letter;	1
and	1
after	1
laughing	1
at	1
her	1
some	1
time,	1
allowed	1
her	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
go--saying,	1
as	1
she	1
quitted	1
the	1
room,	1
"If	1
any	1
young	1
men	1
come	1
for	1
Mary	1
or	1
Kitty,	1
send	1
them	1
in,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
quite	1
at	1
leisure."	1
Elizabeth's	1
mind	1
was	1
now	1
relieved	1
from	1
a	1
very	1
heavy	1
weight;	1
and,	1
after	1
half	1
an	1
hour's	1
quiet	1
reflection	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
room,	1
she	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
others	1
with	1
tolerable	1
composure.	1
Every	1
thing	1
was	1
too	1
recent	1
for	1
gaiety,	1
but	1
the	1
evening	1
passed	1
tranquilly	1
away;	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
anything	1
material	1
to	1
be	1
dreaded,	1
and	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
ease	1
and	1
familiarity	1
would	1
come	1
in	1
time.	1
When	1
her	1
mother	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
dressing-room	1
at	1
night,	1
she	1
followed	1
her,	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
important	1
communication.	1
Its	1
effect	1
was	1
most	1
extraordinary;	1
for	1
on	1
first	1
hearing	1
it,	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
sat	1
quite	1
still,	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
utter	1
a	1
syllable.	1
Nor	1
was	1
it	1
under	1
many,	1
many	1
minutes	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
comprehend	1
what	1
she	1
heard;	1
though	1
not	1
in	1
general	1
backward	1
to	1
credit	1
what	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
her	1
family,	1
or	1
that	1
came	1
in	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
a	1
lover	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
them.	1
She	1
began	1
at	1
length	1
to	1
recover,	1
to	1
fidget	1
about	1
in	1
her	1
chair,	1
get	1
up,	1
sit	1
down	1
again,	1
wonder,	1
and	1
bless	1
herself.	1
"Good	1
gracious!	1
Lord	1
bless	1
me!	1
only	1
think!	1
dear	1
me!	1
Mr.	1
Darcy!	1
Who	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
it!	1
And	1
is	1
it	1
really	1
true?	1
Oh!	1
my	1
sweetest	1
Lizzy!	1
how	1
rich	1
and	1
how	1
great	1
you	1
will	1
be!	1
What	1
pin-money,	1
what	1
jewels,	1
what	1
carriages	1
you	1
will	1
have!	1
Jane's	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
it--nothing	1
at	1
all.	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
pleased--so	1
happy.	1
Such	1
a	1
charming	1
man!--so	1
handsome!	1
so	1
tall!--Oh,	1
my	1
dear	1
Lizzy!	1
pray	1
apologise	1
for	1
my	1
having	1
disliked	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
before.	1
I	1
hope	1
he	1
will	1
overlook	1
it.	1
Dear,	1
dear	1
Lizzy.	1
A	1
house	1
in	1
town!	1
Every	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
charming!	1
Three	1
daughters	1
married!	1
Ten	1
thousand	1
a	1
year!	1
Oh,	1
Lord!	1
What	1
will	1
become	1
of	1
me.	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
distracted."	1
This	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
her	1
approbation	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
doubted:	1
and	1
Elizabeth,	1
rejoicing	1
that	1
such	1
an	1
effusion	1
was	1
heard	1
only	1
by	1
herself,	1
soon	1
went	1
away.	1
But	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
three	1
minutes	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
room,	1
her	1
mother	1
followed	1
her.	1
"My	1
dearest	1
child,"	1
she	1
cried,	1
"I	1
can	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
else!	1
Ten	1
thousand	1
a	1
year,	1
and	1
very	1
likely	1
more!	1
'Tis	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
a	1
Lord!	1
And	1
a	1
special	1
licence.	1
You	1
must	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
married	1
by	1
a	1
special	1
licence.	1
But	1
my	1
dearest	1
love,	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
dish	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
is	1
particularly	1
fond	1
of,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
it	1
to-morrow."	1
This	1
was	1
a	1
sad	1
omen	1
of	1
what	1
her	1
mother's	1
behaviour	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman	1
himself	1
might	1
be;	1
and	1
Elizabeth	1
found	1
that,	1
though	1
in	1
the	1
certain	1
possession	1
of	1
his	1
warmest	1
affection,	1
and	1
secure	1
of	1
her	1
relations'	1
consent,	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
something	1
to	1
be	1
wished	1
for.	1
But	1
the	1
morrow	1
passed	1
off	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
she	1
expected;	1
for	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
luckily	1
stood	1
in	1
such	1
awe	1
of	1
her	1
intended	1
son-in-law	1
that	1
she	1
ventured	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
him,	1
unless	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
offer	1
him	1
any	1
attention,	1
or	1
mark	1
her	1
deference	1
for	1
his	1
opinion.	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
seeing	1
her	1
father	1
taking	1
pains	1
to	1
get	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
soon	1
assured	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
rising	1
every	1
hour	1
in	1
his	1
esteem.	1
"I	1
admire	1
all	1
my	1
three	1
sons-in-law	1
highly,"	1
said	1
he.	1
"Wickham,	1
perhaps,	1
is	1
my	1
favourite;	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
shall	1
like	1
_your_	1
husband	1
quite	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Jane's."	1
Chapter	1
60	1
Elizabeth's	1
spirits	1
soon	1
rising	1
to	1
playfulness	1
again,	1
she	1
wanted	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
his	1
having	1
ever	1
fallen	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her.	1
"How	1
could	1
you	1
begin?"	1
said	1
she.	1
"I	1
can	1
comprehend	1
your	1
going	1
on	1
charmingly,	1
when	1
you	1
had	1
once	1
made	1
a	1
beginning;	1
but	1
what	1
could	1
set	1
you	1
off	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place?"	1
"I	1
cannot	1
fix	1
on	1
the	1
hour,	1
or	1
the	1
spot,	1
or	1
the	1
look,	1
or	1
the	1
words,	1
which	1
laid	1
the	1
foundation.	1
It	1
is	1
too	1
long	1
ago.	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
before	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
I	1
_had_	1
begun."	1
"My	1
beauty	1
you	1
had	1
early	1
withstood,	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
my	1
manners--my	1
behaviour	1
to	1
_you_	1
was	1
at	1
least	1
always	1
bordering	1
on	1
the	1
uncivil,	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
spoke	1
to	1
you	1
without	1
rather	1
wishing	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
pain	1
than	1
not.	1
Now	1
be	1
sincere;	1
did	1
you	1
admire	1
me	1
for	1
my	1
impertinence?"	1
"For	1
the	1
liveliness	1
of	1
your	1
mind,	1
I	1
did."	1
"You	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
call	1
it	1
impertinence	1
at	1
once.	1
It	1
was	1
very	1
little	1
less.	1
The	1
fact	1
is,	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
sick	1
of	1
civility,	1
of	1
deference,	1
of	1
officious	1
attention.	1
You	1
were	1
disgusted	1
with	1
the	1
women	1
who	1
were	1
always	1
speaking,	1
and	1
looking,	1
and	1
thinking	1
for	1
_your_	1
approbation	1
alone.	1
I	1
roused,	1
and	1
interested	1
you,	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
unlike	1
_them_.	1
Had	1
you	1
not	1
been	1
really	1
amiable,	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
hated	1
me	1
for	1
it;	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
pains	1
you	1
took	1
to	1
disguise	1
yourself,	1
your	1
feelings	1
were	1
always	1
noble	1
and	1
just;	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
heart,	1
you	1
thoroughly	1
despised	1
the	1
persons	1
who	1
so	1
assiduously	1
courted	1
you.	1
There--I	1
have	1
saved	1
you	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
accounting	1
for	1
it;	1
and	1
really,	1
all	1
things	1
considered,	1
I	1
begin	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
perfectly	1
reasonable.	1
To	1
be	1
sure,	1
you	1
knew	1
no	1
actual	1
good	1
of	1
me--but	1
nobody	1
thinks	1
of	1
_that_	1
when	1
they	1
fall	1
in	1
love."	1
"Was	1
there	1
no	1
good	1
in	1
your	1
affectionate	1
behaviour	1
to	1
Jane	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
ill	1
at	1
Netherfield?"	1
"Dearest	1
Jane!	1
who	1
could	1
have	1
done	1
less	1
for	1
her?	1
But	1
make	1
a	1
virtue	1
of	1
it	1
by	1
all	1
means.	1
My	1
good	1
qualities	1
are	1
under	1
your	1
protection,	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
exaggerate	1
them	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
possible;	1
and,	1
in	1
return,	1
it	1
belongs	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
find	1
occasions	1
for	1
teasing	1
and	1
quarrelling	1
with	1
you	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
may	1
be;	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
begin	1
directly	1
by	1
asking	1
you	1
what	1
made	1
you	1
so	1
unwilling	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
at	1
last.	1
What	1
made	1
you	1
so	1
shy	1
of	1
me,	1
when	1
you	1
first	1
called,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
dined	1
here?	1
Why,	1
especially,	1
when	1
you	1
called,	1
did	1
you	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
about	1
me?"	1
"Because	1
you	1
were	1
grave	1
and	1
silent,	1
and	1
gave	1
me	1
no	1
encouragement."	1
"But	1
I	1
was	1
embarrassed."	1
"And	1
so	1
was	1
I."	1
"You	1
might	1
have	1
talked	1
to	1
me	1
more	1
when	1
you	1
came	1
to	1
dinner."	1
"A	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
felt	1
less,	1
might."	1
"How	1
unlucky	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
reasonable	1
answer	1
to	1
give,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
reasonable	1
as	1
to	1
admit	1
it!	1
But	1
I	1
wonder	1
how	1
long	1
you	1
_would_	1
have	1
gone	1
on,	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
to	1
yourself.	1
I	1
wonder	1
when	1
you	1
_would_	1
have	1
spoken,	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
asked	1
you!	1
My	1
resolution	1
of	1
thanking	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
kindness	1
to	1
Lydia	1
had	1
certainly	1
great	1
effect.	1
_Too	1
much_,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid;	1
for	1
what	1
becomes	1
of	1
the	1
moral,	1
if	1
our	1
comfort	1
springs	1
from	1
a	1
breach	1
of	1
promise?	1
for	1
I	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
mentioned	1
the	1
subject.	1
This	1
will	1
never	1
do."	1
"You	1
need	1
not	1
distress	1
yourself.	1
The	1
moral	1
will	1
be	1
perfectly	1
fair.	1
Lady	1
Catherine's	1
unjustifiable	1
endeavours	1
to	1
separate	1
us	1
were	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
removing	1
all	1
my	1
doubts.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
indebted	1
for	1
my	1
present	1
happiness	1
to	1
your	1
eager	1
desire	1
of	1
expressing	1
your	1
gratitude.	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
humour	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
any	1
opening	1
of	1
yours.	1
My	1
aunt's	1
intelligence	1
had	1
given	1
me	1
hope,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
determined	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
know	1
every	1
thing."	1
"Lady	1
Catherine	1
has	1
been	1
of	1
infinite	1
use,	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
happy,	1
for	1
she	1
loves	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use.	1
But	1
tell	1
me,	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
Netherfield	1
for?	1
Was	1
it	1
merely	1
to	1
ride	1
to	1
Longbourn	1
and	1
be	1
embarrassed?	1
or	1
had	1
you	1
intended	1
any	1
more	1
serious	1
consequence?"	1
"My	1
real	1
purpose	1
was	1
to	1
see	1
_you_,	1
and	1
to	1
judge,	1
if	1
I	1
could,	1
whether	1
I	1
might	1
ever	1
hope	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
love	1
me.	1
My	1
avowed	1
one,	1
or	1
what	1
I	1
avowed	1
to	1
myself,	1
was	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
your	1
sister	1
were	1
still	1
partial	1
to	1
Bingley,	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
were,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
confession	1
to	1
him	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
since	1
made."	1
"Shall	1
you	1
ever	1
have	1
courage	1
to	1
announce	1
to	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
befall	1
her?"	1
"I	1
am	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
want	1
more	1
time	1
than	1
courage,	1
Elizabeth.	1
But	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
paper,	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
done	1
directly."	1
"And	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
write	1
myself,	1
I	1
might	1
sit	1
by	1
you	1
and	1
admire	1
the	1
evenness	1
of	1
your	1
writing,	1
as	1
another	1
young	1
lady	1
once	1
did.	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
an	1
aunt,	1
too,	1
who	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
longer	1
neglected."	1
From	1
an	1
unwillingness	1
to	1
confess	1
how	1
much	1
her	1
intimacy	1
with	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
had	1
been	1
over-rated,	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
never	1
yet	1
answered	1
Mrs.	1
Gardiner's	1
long	1
letter;	1
but	1
now,	1
having	1
_that_	1
to	1
communicate	1
which	1
she	1
knew	1
would	1
be	1
most	1
welcome,	1
she	1
was	1
almost	1
ashamed	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
had	1
already	1
lost	1
three	1
days	1
of	1
happiness,	1
and	1
immediately	1
wrote	1
as	1
follows:	1
"I	1
would	1
have	1
thanked	1
you	1
before,	1
my	1
dear	1
aunt,	1
as	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
done,	1
for	1
your	1
long,	1
kind,	1
satisfactory,	1
detail	1
of	1
particulars;	1
but	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
truth,	1
I	1
was	1
too	1
cross	1
to	1
write.	1
You	1
supposed	1
more	1
than	1
really	1
existed.	1
But	1
_now_	1
suppose	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
choose;	1
give	1
a	1
loose	1
rein	1
to	1
your	1
fancy,	1
indulge	1
your	1
imagination	1
in	1
every	1
possible	1
flight	1
which	1
the	1
subject	1
will	1
afford,	1
and	1
unless	1
you	1
believe	1
me	1
actually	1
married,	1
you	1
cannot	1
greatly	1
err.	1
You	1
must	1
write	1
again	1
very	1
soon,	1
and	1
praise	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
than	1
you	1
did	1
in	1
your	1
last.	1
I	1
thank	1
you,	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
for	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
Lakes.	1
How	1
could	1
I	1
be	1
so	1
silly	1
as	1
to	1
wish	1
it!	1
Your	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
ponies	1
is	1
delightful.	1
We	1
will	1
go	1
round	1
the	1
Park	1
every	1
day.	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
happiest	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Perhaps	1
other	1
people	1
have	1
said	1
so	1
before,	1
but	1
not	1
one	1
with	1
such	1
justice.	1
I	1
am	1
happier	1
even	1
than	1
Jane;	1
she	1
only	1
smiles,	1
I	1
laugh.	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
sends	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
love	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
spare	1
from	1
me.	1
You	1
are	1
all	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
Pemberley	1
at	1
Christmas.	1
Yours,	1
etc."	1
Mr.	1
Darcy's	1
letter	1
to	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
different	1
style;	1
and	1
still	1
different	1
from	1
either	1
was	1
what	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
sent	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
his	1
last.	1
"DEAR	1
SIR,	1
"I	1
must	1
trouble	1
you	1
once	1
more	1
for	1
congratulations.	1
Elizabeth	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Mr.	1
Darcy.	1
Console	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
you	1
can.	1
But,	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
you,	1
I	1
would	1
stand	1
by	1
the	1
nephew.	1
He	1
has	1
more	1
to	1
give.	1
"Yours	1
sincerely,	1
etc."	1
Miss	1
Bingley's	1
congratulations	1
to	1
her	1
brother,	1
on	1
his	1
approaching	1
marriage,	1
were	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
affectionate	1
and	1
insincere.	1
She	1
wrote	1
even	1
to	1
Jane	1
on	1
the	1
occasion,	1
to	1
express	1
her	1
delight,	1
and	1
repeat	1
all	1
her	1
former	1
professions	1
of	1
regard.	1
Jane	1
was	1
not	1
deceived,	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
affected;	1
and	1
though	1
feeling	1
no	1
reliance	1
on	1
her,	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
writing	1
her	1
a	1
much	1
kinder	1
answer	1
than	1
she	1
knew	1
was	1
deserved.	1
The	1
joy	1
which	1
Miss	1
Darcy	1
expressed	1
on	1
receiving	1
similar	1
information,	1
was	1
as	1
sincere	1
as	1
her	1
brother's	1
in	1
sending	1
it.	1
Four	1
sides	1
of	1
paper	1
were	1
insufficient	1
to	1
contain	1
all	1
her	1
delight,	1
and	1
all	1
her	1
earnest	1
desire	1
of	1
being	1
loved	1
by	1
her	1
sister.	1
Before	1
any	1
answer	1
could	1
arrive	1
from	1
Mr.	1
Collins,	1
or	1
any	1
congratulations	1
to	1
Elizabeth	1
from	1
his	1
wife,	1
the	1
Longbourn	1
family	1
heard	1
that	1
the	1
Collinses	1
were	1
come	1
themselves	1
to	1
Lucas	1
Lodge.	1
The	1
reason	1
of	1
this	1
sudden	1
removal	1
was	1
soon	1
evident.	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
had	1
been	1
rendered	1
so	1
exceedingly	1
angry	1
by	1
the	1
contents	1
of	1
her	1
nephew's	1
letter,	1
that	1
Charlotte,	1
really	1
rejoicing	1
in	1
the	1
match,	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
till	1
the	1
storm	1
was	1
blown	1
over.	1
At	1
such	1
a	1
moment,	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
her	1
friend	1
was	1
a	1
sincere	1
pleasure	1
to	1
Elizabeth,	1
though	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
their	1
meetings	1
she	1
must	1
sometimes	1
think	1
the	1
pleasure	1
dearly	1
bought,	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
exposed	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
parading	1
and	1
obsequious	1
civility	1
of	1
her	1
husband.	1
He	1
bore	1
it,	1
however,	1
with	1
admirable	1
calmness.	1
He	1
could	1
even	1
listen	1
to	1
Sir	1
William	1
Lucas,	1
when	1
he	1
complimented	1
him	1
on	1
carrying	1
away	1
the	1
brightest	1
jewel	1
of	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
expressed	1
his	1
hopes	1
of	1
their	1
all	1
meeting	1
frequently	1
at	1
St.	1
James's,	1
with	1
very	1
decent	1
composure.	1
If	1
he	1
did	1
shrug	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
till	1
Sir	1
William	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
sight.	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips's	1
vulgarity	1
was	1
another,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
a	1
greater,	1
tax	1
on	1
his	1
forbearance;	1
and	1
though	1
Mrs.	1
Phillips,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
her	1
sister,	1
stood	1
in	1
too	1
much	1
awe	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
the	1
familiarity	1
which	1
Bingley's	1
good	1
humour	1
encouraged,	1
yet,	1
whenever	1
she	1
_did_	1
speak,	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
vulgar.	1
Nor	1
was	1
her	1
respect	1
for	1
him,	1
though	1
it	1
made	1
her	1
more	1
quiet,	1
at	1
all	1
likely	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
more	1
elegant.	1
Elizabeth	1
did	1
all	1
she	1
could	1
to	1
shield	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
frequent	1
notice	1
of	1
either,	1
and	1
was	1
ever	1
anxious	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
to	1
herself,	1
and	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
her	1
family	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
might	1
converse	1
without	1
mortification;	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
uncomfortable	1
feelings	1
arising	1
from	1
all	1
this	1
took	1
from	1
the	1
season	1
of	1
courtship	1
much	1
of	1
its	1
pleasure,	1
it	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
the	1
future;	1
and	1
she	1
looked	1
forward	1
with	1
delight	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
removed	1
from	1
society	1
so	1
little	1
pleasing	1
to	1
either,	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
comfort	1
and	1
elegance	1
of	1
their	1
family	1
party	1
at	1
Pemberley.	1
Chapter	1
61	1
Happy	1
for	1
all	1
her	1
maternal	1
feelings	1
was	1
the	1
day	1
on	1
which	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
her	1
two	1
most	1
deserving	1
daughters.	1
With	1
what	1
delighted	1
pride	1
she	1
afterwards	1
visited	1
Mrs.	1
Bingley,	1
and	1
talked	1
of	1
Mrs.	1
Darcy,	1
may	1
be	1
guessed.	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
say,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
her	1
family,	1
that	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
her	1
earnest	1
desire	1
in	1
the	1
establishment	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
her	1
children	1
produced	1
so	1
happy	1
an	1
effect	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
a	1
sensible,	1
amiable,	1
well-informed	1
woman	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
her	1
life;	1
though	1
perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
lucky	1
for	1
her	1
husband,	1
who	1
might	1
not	1
have	1
relished	1
domestic	1
felicity	1
in	1
so	1
unusual	1
a	1
form,	1
that	1
she	1
still	1
was	1
occasionally	1
nervous	1
and	1
invariably	1
silly.	1
Mr.	1
Bennet	1
missed	1
his	1
second	1
daughter	1
exceedingly;	1
his	1
affection	1
for	1
her	1
drew	1
him	1
oftener	1
from	1
home	1
than	1
anything	1
else	1
could	1
do.	1
He	1
delighted	1
in	1
going	1
to	1
Pemberley,	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
least	1
expected.	1
Mr.	1
Bingley	1
and	1
Jane	1
remained	1
at	1
Netherfield	1
only	1
a	1
twelvemonth.	1
So	1
near	1
a	1
vicinity	1
to	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
Meryton	1
relations	1
was	1
not	1
desirable	1
even	1
to	1
_his_	1
easy	1
temper,	1
or	1
_her_	1
affectionate	1
heart.	1
The	1
darling	1
wish	1
of	1
his	1
sisters	1
was	1
then	1
gratified;	1
he	1
bought	1
an	1
estate	1
in	1
a	1
neighbouring	1
county	1
to	1
Derbyshire,	1
and	1
Jane	1
and	1
Elizabeth,	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
every	1
other	1
source	1
of	1
happiness,	1
were	1
within	1
thirty	1
miles	1
of	1
each	1
other.	1
Kitty,	1
to	1
her	1
very	1
material	1
advantage,	1
spent	1
the	1
chief	1
of	1
her	1
time	1
with	1
her	1
two	1
elder	1
sisters.	1
In	1
society	1
so	1
superior	1
to	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
generally	1
known,	1
her	1
improvement	1
was	1
great.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
of	1
so	1
ungovernable	1
a	1
temper	1
as	1
Lydia;	1
and,	1
removed	1
from	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
Lydia's	1
example,	1
she	1
became,	1
by	1
proper	1
attention	1
and	1
management,	1
less	1
irritable,	1
less	1
ignorant,	1
and	1
less	1
insipid.	1
From	1
the	1
further	1
disadvantage	1
of	1
Lydia's	1
society	1
she	1
was	1
of	1
course	1
carefully	1
kept,	1
and	1
though	1
Mrs.	1
Wickham	1
frequently	1
invited	1
her	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
stay	1
with	1
her,	1
with	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
balls	1
and	1
young	1
men,	1
her	1
father	1
would	1
never	1
consent	1
to	1
her	1
going.	1
Mary	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
daughter	1
who	1
remained	1
at	1
home;	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
necessarily	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
accomplishments	1
by	1
Mrs.	1
Bennet's	1
being	1
quite	1
unable	1
to	1
sit	1
alone.	1
Mary	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
mix	1
more	1
with	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
she	1
could	1
still	1
moralize	1
over	1
every	1
morning	1
visit;	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
mortified	1
by	1
comparisons	1
between	1
her	1
sisters'	1
beauty	1
and	1
her	1
own,	1
it	1
was	1
suspected	1
by	1
her	1
father	1
that	1
she	1
submitted	1
to	1
the	1
change	1
without	1
much	1
reluctance.	1
As	1
for	1
Wickham	1
and	1
Lydia,	1
their	1
characters	1
suffered	1
no	1
revolution	1
from	1
the	1
marriage	1
of	1
her	1
sisters.	1
He	1
bore	1
with	1
philosophy	1
the	1
conviction	1
that	1
Elizabeth	1
must	1
now	1
become	1
acquainted	1
with	1
whatever	1
of	1
his	1
ingratitude	1
and	1
falsehood	1
had	1
before	1
been	1
unknown	1
to	1
her;	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
every	1
thing,	1
was	1
not	1
wholly	1
without	1
hope	1
that	1
Darcy	1
might	1
yet	1
be	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
fortune.	1
The	1
congratulatory	1
letter	1
which	1
Elizabeth	1
received	1
from	1
Lydia	1
on	1
her	1
marriage,	1
explained	1
to	1
her	1
that,	1
by	1
his	1
wife	1
at	1
least,	1
if	1
not	1
by	1
himself,	1
such	1
a	1
hope	1
was	1
cherished.	1
The	1
letter	1
was	1
to	1
this	1
effect:	1
"MY	1
DEAR	1
LIZZY,	1
"I	1
wish	1
you	1
joy.	1
If	1
you	1
love	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
half	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
my	1
dear	1
Wickham,	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
happy.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
comfort	1
to	1
have	1
you	1
so	1
rich,	1
and	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
do,	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
think	1
of	1
us.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
Wickham	1
would	1
like	1
a	1
place	1
at	1
court	1
very	1
much,	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
quite	1
money	1
enough	1
to	1
live	1
upon	1
without	1
some	1
help.	1
Any	1
place	1
would	1
do,	1
of	1
about	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
hundred	1
a	1
year;	1
but	1
however,	1
do	1
not	1
speak	1
to	1
Mr.	1
Darcy	1
about	1
it,	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
rather	1
not.	1
"Yours,	1
etc."	1
As	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
Elizabeth	1
had	1
_much_	1
rather	1
not,	1
she	1
endeavoured	1
in	1
her	1
answer	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
every	1
entreaty	1
and	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
Such	1
relief,	1
however,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
her	1
power	1
to	1
afford,	1
by	1
the	1
practice	1
of	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
economy	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
private	1
expences,	1
she	1
frequently	1
sent	1
them.	1
It	1
had	1
always	1
been	1
evident	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
such	1
an	1
income	1
as	1
theirs,	1
under	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
two	1
persons	1
so	1
extravagant	1
in	1
their	1
wants,	1
and	1
heedless	1
of	1
the	1
future,	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
insufficient	1
to	1
their	1
support;	1
and	1
whenever	1
they	1
changed	1
their	1
quarters,	1
either	1
Jane	1
or	1
herself	1
were	1
sure	1
of	1
being	1
applied	1
to	1
for	1
some	1
little	1
assistance	1
towards	1
discharging	1
their	1
bills.	1
Their	1
manner	1
of	1
living,	1
even	1
when	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
peace	1
dismissed	1
them	1
to	1
a	1
home,	1
was	1
unsettled	1
in	1
the	1
extreme.	1
They	1
were	1
always	1
moving	1
from	1
place	1
to	1
place	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
a	1
cheap	1
situation,	1
and	1
always	1
spending	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
ought.	1
His	1
affection	1
for	1
her	1
soon	1
sunk	1
into	1
indifference;	1
hers	1
lasted	1
a	1
little	1
longer;	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
youth	1
and	1
her	1
manners,	1
she	1
retained	1
all	1
the	1
claims	1
to	1
reputation	1
which	1
her	1
marriage	1
had	1
given	1
her.	1
Though	1
Darcy	1
could	1
never	1
receive	1
_him_	1
at	1
Pemberley,	1
yet,	1
for	1
Elizabeth's	1
sake,	1
he	1
assisted	1
him	1
further	1
in	1
his	1
profession.	1
Lydia	1
was	1
occasionally	1
a	1
visitor	1
there,	1
when	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
gone	1
to	1
enjoy	1
himself	1
in	1
London	1
or	1
Bath;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
Bingleys	1
they	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
frequently	1
staid	1
so	1
long,	1
that	1
even	1
Bingley's	1
good	1
humour	1
was	1
overcome,	1
and	1
he	1
proceeded	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
giving	1
them	1
a	1
hint	1
to	1
be	1
gone.	1
Miss	1
Bingley	1
was	1
very	1
deeply	1
mortified	1
by	1
Darcy's	1
marriage;	1
but	1
as	1
she	1
thought	1
it	1
advisable	1
to	1
retain	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
visiting	1
at	1
Pemberley,	1
she	1
dropt	1
all	1
her	1
resentment;	1
was	1
fonder	1
than	1
ever	1
of	1
Georgiana,	1
almost	1
as	1
attentive	1
to	1
Darcy	1
as	1
heretofore,	1
and	1
paid	1
off	1
every	1
arrear	1
of	1
civility	1
to	1
Elizabeth.	1
Pemberley	1
was	1
now	1
Georgiana's	1
home;	1
and	1
the	1
attachment	1
of	1
the	1
sisters	1
was	1
exactly	1
what	1
Darcy	1
had	1
hoped	1
to	1
see.	1
They	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
love	1
each	1
other	1
even	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
they	1
intended.	1
Georgiana	1
had	1
the	1
highest	1
opinion	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
Elizabeth;	1
though	1
at	1
first	1
she	1
often	1
listened	1
with	1
an	1
astonishment	1
bordering	1
on	1
alarm	1
at	1
her	1
lively,	1
sportive,	1
manner	1
of	1
talking	1
to	1
her	1
brother.	1
He,	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
inspired	1
in	1
herself	1
a	1
respect	1
which	1
almost	1
overcame	1
her	1
affection,	1
she	1
now	1
saw	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
open	1
pleasantry.	1
Her	1
mind	1
received	1
knowledge	1
which	1
had	1
never	1
before	1
fallen	1
in	1
her	1
way.	1
By	1
Elizabeth's	1
instructions,	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
comprehend	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
may	1
take	1
liberties	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
which	1
a	1
brother	1
will	1
not	1
always	1
allow	1
in	1
a	1
sister	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
years	1
younger	1
than	1
himself.	1
Lady	1
Catherine	1
was	1
extremely	1
indignant	1
on	1
the	1
marriage	1
of	1
her	1
nephew;	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
genuine	1
frankness	1
of	1
her	1
character	1
in	1
her	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
letter	1
which	1
announced	1
its	1
arrangement,	1
she	1
sent	1
him	1
language	1
so	1
very	1
abusive,	1
especially	1
of	1
Elizabeth,	1
that	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
all	1
intercourse	1
was	1
at	1
an	1
end.	1
But	1
at	1
length,	1
by	1
Elizabeth's	1
persuasion,	1
he	1
was	1
prevailed	1
on	1
to	1
overlook	1
the	1
offence,	1
and	1
seek	1
a	1
reconciliation;	1
and,	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
further	1
resistance	1
on	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
aunt,	1
her	1
resentment	1
gave	1
way,	1
either	1
to	1
her	1
affection	1
for	1
him,	1
or	1
her	1
curiosity	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
his	1
wife	1
conducted	1
herself;	1
and	1
she	1
condescended	1
to	1
wait	1
on	1
them	1
at	1
Pemberley,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
that	1
pollution	1
which	1
its	1
woods	1
had	1
received,	1
not	1
merely	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
mistress,	1
but	1
the	1
visits	1
of	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
aunt	1
from	1
the	1
city.	1
With	1
the	1
Gardiners,	1
they	1
were	1
always	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
intimate	1
terms.	1
Darcy,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Elizabeth,	1
really	1
loved	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
ever	1
sensible	1
of	1
the	1
warmest	1
gratitude	1
towards	1
the	1
persons	1
who,	1
by	1
bringing	1
her	1
into	1
Derbyshire,	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
uniting	1
them.	1
